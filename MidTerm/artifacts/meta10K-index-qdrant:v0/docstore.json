Delaware law could\nrequire either holders of our Class A common stock or our Class B common stock to vote separately as a single class in the following circumstances:\n\u2022if we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of a class of stock, or to\nincrease or decrease the par value of a class of stock, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment; and\n\u2022if we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in a manner that alters or changes the powers, preferences or special\nrights of a class of stock in a manner that affected its holders adversely, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed\namendment.\nStockholders do not have the ability to cumulate votes for the election of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and\nrestated bylaws provide for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size, each serving staggered three-year terms,\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock. Our directors will be\nassigned by the then-current board of directors to a class when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the\ncombined voting power of common stock.\nNo Preemptive or Similar Rights\nOur common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions.\n1Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions\nUpon our dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders\nof our common stock, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights and payment of liquidation preferences, if\nany, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock.\nConversion\nThe outstanding shares of Class B common stock are convertible at any time as follows: (1) at the option of the holder, a share of Class B common stock\nmay be converted at any time into one share of Class A common stock or (2) upon the election of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of\nClass B common stock, all outstanding shares of Class B common stock may be converted into shares of Class A common stock. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value, except for certain\ntransfers described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including transfers to family members, trusts solely for the benefit of the\nstockholder or their family members, and partnerships, corporations, and other entities exclusively owned by the stockholder or their family members. Once\nconverted or transferred and converted into Class A common stock, the Class B common stock will not be reissued.\nPreferred Stock\nSubject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time\nto time the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and any of its\nqualifications, limitations or restrictions. Our board of directors also can increase or decrease the number of shares of any series, but not below the number of\nshares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred\nstock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of\npreferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nSo long as the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, Mark Zuckerberg\nwill effectively control all matters submitted to our stockholders for a vote, as well as the overall management and direction of our company, which will have\nthe effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another person from acquiring control of our company.\nAfter such time as the shares of our Class B common stock no longer represent a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, the\nprovisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying,\ndeferring or discouraging another person from acquiring control of our company.\nDelaware Law\nA Delaware corporation may \u201copt out\u201d of these provisions with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or an express provision in its\ncertificate of incorporation or bylaws resulting from a stockholders\u2019 amendment approved by at least a majority of the outstanding voting shares. We have\nexpressly elected not to be governed by the business combination provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\n2Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of\ndeterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control of our company, even after such time as the shares of our Class B common stock no\nlonger represent a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, including the following:\n\u2022Separate Class B Vote for Certain Transactions. Any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a\nmajority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class until such time as shares of our Class B common stock represent less than\nthirty-five percent (35%) of the combined voting power of our common stock. This provision could delay or prevent the approval of a change in control\nthat might otherwise be approved by a majority of outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock voting together on a combined basis.\n\u2022Dual Class Stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mark\nZuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant\ncorporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets.\n\u2022Supermajority Approvals. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws do not provide that certain\namendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws by stockholders will require the approval of two-\nthirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock. However, when the outstanding shares of our Class B\ncommon stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate\nof incorporation or amended and restated bylaws by stockholders will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding\nshares of Class A and Class B common stock. This will have the effect of making it more difficult to amend our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation or amended and restated bylaws to remove or modify certain provisions.\n\u2022Board of Directors Vacancies. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that stockholders may\nfill vacant directorships. When the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of\ncommon stock, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws authorize only our board of directors to fill vacant\ndirectorships. In addition, the number of directors constituting our board of directors is set only by resolution adopted by a majority vote of our entire\nboard of directors. These provisions restricting the filling of vacancies will prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of our board of directors and\ngaining control of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees.\n\u2022Classified Board. Our board of directors is not classified. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws\nprovide that when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, our\nboard of directors will be classified into three classes of directors each of which will hold office for a three-year term. In addition, thereafter, directors may\nonly be removed from the board of directors for cause. The existence of a classified board could delay a successful tender offeror from obtaining majority\ncontrol of our board of directors, and the prospect of that delay might deter a potential offeror.\n\u2022Stockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders will be able to\ntake action by written consent. When the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of\ncommon stock, our stockholders will no longer be able to take action by written consent, and will only be able to take action at annual or special meetings\nof our stockholders. Stockholders will not be permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors. Our amended and restated bylaws further\nprovide that special meetings of our\n3stockholders may be called only by a majority of our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or our president.\n\u2022Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations. Our amended and restated bylaws provide advance notice\nprocedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at any\nmeeting of stockholders. Our amended and restated bylaws also specify certain requirements regarding the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice.\nThese provisions may preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for\ndirectors at our meetings of stockholders.\n\u2022Issuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock. Our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to\n100,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the board of\ndirectors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an\nattempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise.\nChoice of Forum\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any\nderivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant\nto the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a\nclaim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nListing\nOur Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cMETA.\u201d\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A.\n4EXHIBIT 21.1\nLIST OF SUBSIDIARIES\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCassin Networks ApS (Denmark)\nEdge Network Services Limited (Ireland)\nFacebook Circularity, LLC (Delaware)\nFacebook Holdings, LLC (Delaware)\nFacebook India Online Services Private Limited (India)\nFacebook Operations, LLC (Delaware)\nFacebook Procurement LLC (Delaware)\nFacebook Servi\u00e7os Online Do Brasil Ltda.

or\nsubsidiaries if they perform policy-making functions for the Company) and (vi) any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the\nCompany. Policy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant. The determination as to an individual\u2019s status as\nan Executive Officer shall be made by the Committee and such determination shall be final, conclusive and binding on such individual and all other interested\npersons.\n(g) \u201cFinancial Reporting Measure\u201d means any (i) measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in\npreparing the Company\u2019s financial statements, (ii) stock price measure or (iii) total shareholder return measure (and any measures that are derived wholly or in\npart from any measure referenced in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above). For the avoidance of doubt, any such measure does not need to be presented within the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements or included in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to constitute a Financial Reporting Measure.(h) \u201cFinancial Restatement\u201d means a restatement of the Company\u2019s financial statements due to the Company\u2019s material noncompliance with any\nfinancial reporting requirement under U.S. federal securities laws that is required in order to correct:\n(i) an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements; or\n(ii) an error that would result in a material misstatement if (A) the error were corrected in the current period or (B) left uncorrected in the current\nperiod.\nFor purposes of this Policy, a Financial Restatement shall not be deemed to occur in the event of a revision of the Company\u2019s financial statements due to an\nout-of-period adjustment (i.e., when the error is immaterial to the previously issued financial statements and the correction of the error is also immaterial to the\ncurrent period) or a retrospective (1) application of a change in accounting principles; (2) revision to reportable segment information due to a change in the\nstructure of the Company\u2019s internal organization; (3) reclassification due to a discontinued operation; (4) application of a change in reporting entity, such as\nfrom a reorganization of entities under common control; or (5) revision for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends or other changes in capital\nstructure.\n(j) \u201cIncentive-based Compensation\u201d means any compensation (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any cash or equity or equity-based\ncompensation, whether deferred or current) that is granted, earned and/or vested based wholly or in part upon the achievement of a Financial Reporting\nMeasure.

provided that, before concluding that it would be\nimpracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to this Section 2(d), the Company shall have first made a\nreasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to make such recovery and provide\nthat documentation to the Nasdaq;\n(ii) recovery of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which\nbenefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 401(a)(13) or 411(a) of the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\n(e) The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executive, directly or indirectly, for any losses that such Covered Executive may incur in\nconnection with the recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to this Policy, including through the payment of insurance premiums or gross-up\npayments.\n(f) The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, the manner and timing in which any Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be recovered\nfrom a Covered Executive in accordance with applicable law, including, without limitation, by (i) requiring reimbursement of Covered Compensation\npreviously paid in cash; (ii) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer or other disposition of any equity or equity-\nbased awards; (iii) offsetting the Erroneously Awarded Compensation amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company or any of its affiliates\nto the Covered Executive; (iv) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity or equity-based awards; and/or (v) taking any other remedial and recovery\naction permitted by applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, except as set forth in Section 2(d), in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less\nthan the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation; provided that, to the extent necessary to avoid any adverse tax consequences to the Covered Executive\npursuant to Section 409A of the Code, any offsets against amounts under any nonqualified deferred compensation plans (as defined under Section 409A of the\nCode) shall be made in compliance with Section 409A of the Code.\n3.Administration.

We define \"violating\"\naccounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam.

We build technology that helps people connect and\nshare, find communities, and grow businesses. Our products enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal\ncomputers, virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) headsets, and wearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world\naround them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with audiences ranging from their closest family members\nand friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward\nimmersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the metaverse, which we believe is the next evolution in social technology. Our vision\nfor the metaverse does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in\nthe very early stages of its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction. Across our work, we are\ninnovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful, and immersive.\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from\nselling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a\nrange of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content.\n", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2148, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "490a5f39-21f0-40ff-b9d4-5fefc5b723da": {"__data__": {"id_": "490a5f39-21f0-40ff-b9d4-5fefc5b723da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4f077e00-7b85-4195-9ff0-c8b78f5f9549", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "5d2440c57baddfbcf7e3bfe1008bd0f2ec04ec5cb4b9606fb5aa23ca7026c788", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "444870a1-2be1-421f-85fe-279fc11c646d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "7a88bf6be522ba245cf3a1cb053d730310ec34e0f9ad2f92e58730158bd0789d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e58ddd87-0dad-49f0-9434-c544b023b366", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9499f79b261f4674953f17de7dcef16dd713f9e3d123a56cb88e0763fc70a58", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We invest in our business based on our company priorities.

In 2023, 80% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in\nFoA and 20% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $70.13 billion in 2023 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical\ninfrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts,\nincluding developing virtual and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our total RL\ninvestments were $18.02 billion in 2023 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are fundamentally\nnew technologies that we expect will evolve as the metaverse ecosystem develops, and many products for the metaverse may only be fully realized in the next\ndecade.

This includes exploring new technologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which lets\npeople control their devices using neuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in AI and hardware to help build next-generation interfaces. In the near term,\nwe are continuing to develop early metaverse experiences through Reality Labs products that help people feel connected, anytime, anywhere.\nOur current product offerings in VR include our Meta Quest devices, as well as software and content available through the Meta Quest Store, which\nenable a range of social experiences that allow people to defy physical distance while engaging in gaming, fitness, entertainment, and more. For example, Meta\nHorizon Worlds is a social platform where people can interact with friends, meet new people, play games, and attend virtual events.\nTo drive greater adoption and acceptance of VR we have also introduced MR capabilities, which allow users to experience the immersion and presence\nof VR while still being grounded in the physical world, through our Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 3 devices.\nWe have continued to advance our augmented reality (AR) roadmap to include offerings such as the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which feature Meta\nAI, our advanced conversational assistant, as well as offer the ability to livestream video and let people stay more present through hands-free interaction. We\nalso offer Meta Spark, a platform that allows creators and businesses to build AR experiences that bring the digital and physical worlds together in our apps.\nIn general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the metaverse, our VR and social platform efforts also include\nnotable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to go to market, whereas our AR efforts are primarily directed toward longer-term\nresearch and development projects. For example, in 2024, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating expenses on our AR initiatives,\napproximately 40% on our VR (including MR) initiatives, and approximately 10% on social platforms and other initiatives. We apply significant judgment in\nestimating this expense breakdown as there are certain shared costs across product lines, and our expectations are subject to change, including as the metaverse\necosystem and our business strategies evolve.

These laws and regulations involve matters including\nprivacy, data use, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content,\nintegrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, AI\nand machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility,\ntelecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law\ncompliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and other\nlaws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States, and create the potential for significant fines to be\nimposed.\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to\ngovernment entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws\nand regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or\nlitigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in\nvarious ways, including for advertising, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, could adversely affect our financial results,\nincluding by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court\nheard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act\n(Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various efforts to\nremove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230, and any such changes may increase our costs or require\nsignificant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain\ndata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services.\nIf we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products\nand services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely\naffect our financial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United\nStates, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such\ndata, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, although the CJEU upheld the\nvalidity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the Irish Data Protection\nCommittee (IDPC) issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic\nArea (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine\nof EUR \u20ac1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into\ncompliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the United States. We are appealing this decision and\nthe corrective orders are currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court.

A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create considerable\nuncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which\nwould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or new legislation and regulations\ncould significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements\nunder the GDPR, and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead\nEuropean Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other\nrequirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft decisions in investigations\nby the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes\nin the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for\nnon-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations. In\naddition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on\nproducts and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act,\nand similar laws recently enacted by other states also establish certain transparency rules and create certain data privacy rights for users. Some states have also\nproposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like\ncomprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to\nall or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising business. In addition, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive and national\nimplementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes\nto our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising\nbusiness.

Our financial performance has been\nand will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions,\nparticularly for Facebook and Instagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user\nbase in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also\nimpacted by a number of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our\nproducts and services, as well as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic led to\nincreases and decreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to period at different points during the pandemic. In addition, in\nconnection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and these services were then prohibited by the Russian\ngovernment, which contributed to slight decreases in the size of our active user base following the onset of the war. Any future declines in the size of our active\nuser base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or\nincrease the frequency and duration of their engagement.

For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, have\nimpacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the number of users\nopting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy Directive\ncompliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Judicial and\nregulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions, such as the DMA, may require us to make additional\nchanges to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, in response to regulatory\ndevelopments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European\nEconomic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no\nads\" alternative. We are continuing to engage with regulators on our new consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR,\nDMA, and EU consumer laws.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future\nplans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple\nmade certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers'\nability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers\nare willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users\nthe ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including changes implemented in\nconnection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory frameworks.\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising\nrevenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS\nchanges beginning in 2021. If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities\nwill be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue.\n20", "start_char_idx": 624, "end_char_idx": 4679, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41c4a7c5-5f9c-4490-9c72-eb7738237535": {"__data__": {"id_": "41c4a7c5-5f9c-4490-9c72-eb7738237535", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "543134ba-c567-4b66-918b-bbfe599aa828", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "5bf86634a40d79bba7c7e2730786d0dd7cbd8dfe724cd69418582c7878319595", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "127b3ecb-dd53-402b-9f89-dca3a707b787", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "be3273bc45e3531f02d14e7edc17185038f9607c2c437727702a63d8aeddbe70", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b6b53662-4f12-41a7-ac73-0fc066876ac9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7fd154d11f6d2be931732e515c8767d75a7ee40335428b4f9943e7c860d50dbe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies,\nproducts, and standards that we do not control.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue\nto feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability\nof our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS\noperating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system\npartners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have\nmade in the past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products,\ngive preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fees related to the\ndistribution of our products or our delivery of ads have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the usage of our products and monetization\non mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability\nto provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads\neffectively, while expanding their own advertising business. In addition, in January 2024, Google began the process of phasing out third-party cookies in its\nChrome browser. We expect that any similar changes to Apple's, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and\nmeasure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work\nwell with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset\nmanufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the\nmobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is\nmore difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile\ndevices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also\ntake actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such\nactions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser\ndevelopers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that\nour users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could\nbe adversely affected and our business could be harmed. We have experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies,\nproducts, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization\non mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits, or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing\nproducts and to create successful new products, both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant\nchanges to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior\ndevelopment or operating experience. For example, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality\ntechnology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these evolving products and technologies. We are also making\nsignificant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across our business. For example, we recently launched new AI features on our products,\nincluding conversational AIs, stickers, and editing tools.

Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies\nthat sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face\nsignificant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate,\nand discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain\npeople who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who\nbuild compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and\naugmented reality products and services. We also expect to face additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products\nevolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse or innovate through the development\nand application of new technologies such as AI.\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments,\ngeographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political,\nlegal, and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than\nus to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware of and actively\nengaging with other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of\nand engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In addition, from time to time we make updates to our products\nand services to improve the user experience (including to help provide users with safe, positive, age-appropriate experiences), and these changes have had, and\nmay in the future have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products and services. In the event that users\nincreasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which\ncase our business would likely be harmed.\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching\nand successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive\nadvantage against us in areas where we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads;\nby imposing fees or other charges related to our applications or our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it\nmore difficult to communicate with our users; or by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device\noperating systems, search engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated competitive products with iOS\nand Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to iOS that limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to\ntarget and measure ads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue\nat the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and financial results.

Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers\ncould harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face\nmay adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they\nprovide. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, various challenges with the supply chain related to supporting our technical infrastructure.\nAs a result, we have adjusted, and may continue to adjust in the future, our procurement practices to adapt to the evolving landscape.

While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people,\nand it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error\nmargins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews\nof limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these\nestimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information,\nIP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which\nare inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our\nreported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the\nrisk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited\ndata signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from\nWhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products.\nAny loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party\nbrowser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics,\nas well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the\napplication of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve\nour ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us\nto identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\"\naccounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam.

Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual\nnumber of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\nWe also regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among our MAUs. A duplicate account is\none that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide \"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users\nhave created personal profiles for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than\na personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that\nviolate our terms of service, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of\naccounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP\naddresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the\nreviewers. Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile\nplatforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts.\nOur estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may\nallow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate and\nfalse accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our\nestimates.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 10% of our worldwide MAUs. We believe the\npercentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 4% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false\naccounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as\nIndonesia, Vietnam, and Nigeria. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of\nduplicate or false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period.\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline in\nusage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age.\nAccordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete.\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-\ndisclosed location.

In addition, we have faced, currently face, and will continue to face additional class action\nand other lawsuits based on claims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, copyright, user well-being, employment,\ncontingent workers, activities on our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and\nsoftware, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven.

For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in\nChina, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in\nviolation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from\ntime to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and\nblock access to content, and suspend user services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted.

For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a small number of resellers serving advertisers\nbased in China, and it is possible that the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue, whether as a\nresult of the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take\nother action against us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nSimilarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to\nreduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or\nour other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make\nchanges to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or\ncapture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base,\nuser engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and\nour financial results could be adversely affected.\n39", "start_char_idx": 1087, "end_char_idx": 5158, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "311f3264-8373-4e2e-bcbd-c24683f9f217": {"__data__": {"id_": "311f3264-8373-4e2e-bcbd-c24683f9f217", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da568252-e43a-4ea7-8f90-15bc7d6b4f68", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "1c2d510e869b4255b4de1b7317c1f60a5fdc7ea3d2dc522b3f5daa022faafbad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d79c44c-3ac5-43ce-b6f4-5956ef5c9e1a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "537f1c0b3bb3801ae77fdf85ebdc282fd52d82ff22f79dfc7db80a9731734499", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1954f01a-858c-43e4-8693-098dee6cf463", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ccbd186a2d13b974e896aaf4942fd6c94d536d9547390ea3a74df11ddf0b3e15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and data protection, content,\ncompetition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain\ninterpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in\nuser growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data\nuse, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity,\nintellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, AI and\nmachine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility,\ntelecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law\ncompliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or\nother actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy,\ncontent, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United\nStates, and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to\ngovernment entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws\nand regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or\nlitigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in\nvarious ways, including for advertising, could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our\nservices or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain\ndata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services.\nFor example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States,\ncalled the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other\nbases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For\nexample, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought\nby the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final\nDecision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was\nnot in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR \u20ac1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to\nsuspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including\nstorage, of such data in the United States. We are appealing this decision and the corrective orders are currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High\nCourt.\nOn March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. ", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4777, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1954f01a-858c-43e4-8693-098dee6cf463": {"__data__": {"id_": "1954f01a-858c-43e4-8693-098dee6cf463", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da568252-e43a-4ea7-8f90-15bc7d6b4f68", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "1c2d510e869b4255b4de1b7317c1f60a5fdc7ea3d2dc522b3f5daa022faafbad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "311f3264-8373-4e2e-bcbd-c24683f9f217", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "54ca0879573ea87767fd225ed91cf42ed07d2160eab49fe86a23920bb6aea9ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "046eeea0-985b-4a48-a088-39c2d84e627b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b8ae906339edc8b95f152a77f4c3875907fc036ec63fc529292890e89f48a13", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Data Privacy\nFramework (EU-U.S. DPF).

For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements\nunder the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of\npersonal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the\nnotification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the\nCJEU, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency\nmechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as\nwell as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative\nimpact on our business and/or our operations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations\nimposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions.

These\nlaws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers,\nhave to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws\nspecifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws\nare evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those\nstates, adversely affecting our advertising business. In Europe, regulators continue to enforce guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements\nregarding the use of cookies and similar technologies, and may impose specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such\ntechnologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products\nand include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely\naffected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans\nto change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and\nin November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative.

increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines or\ndemands or orders that we modify or cease existing business

inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many of\nwhich are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for\ninformation, actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use and data protection, including\nwith respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security, minors, safety, law enforcement, consumer\nprotection, civil rights, content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. In\naddition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees.

In addition, we have been and continue\nto be the subject of litigation and investigations related to the ways in which we collect and use information, including where advertisers are subject to\nadditional regulation such as housing, employment, credit, and financial services. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state\nattorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices\nas well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into\na settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things, required us to significantly\nenhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other\njurisdictions remain ongoing. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our compliance with the modified consent order and initiated an administrative\nproceeding against us, which we are challenging, that alleges deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the\nCOPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's\naction and the agency imposes its proposed order in its current form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and\nmodified products or use data of users under 18 years old. We also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, and other\nregulators of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other regulators regarding\nvarious aspects of our regulatory compliance.

actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose\nus to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change\nour business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity and\nreputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\nadversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, the ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, and other regulatory\nand legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, and any compliance failures\nmay have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified consent order with the FTC,\nrequirements of the GDPR, and other current and anticipated regulatory and legislative requirements around the world, such as the CCPA, as amended by the\nCPRA, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DSA, the Korean Personal Information Protection Act, and the Indian Digital Personal Data Protection Act. In particular, we\nare maintaining a comprehensive privacy program in connection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors\noversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to\nregularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor,\nwhich has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our\nsystems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing investments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical\ninfrastructure. We continually reallocate resources internally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our\nother business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads\ndevelopment more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a result, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a\ntimely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected. Further, our privacy compliance and oversight efforts have required, and we expect will\ncontinue to require, significant time and attention from our management and board of directors. The requirements of the FTC consent order and other privacy-\nrelated laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not\nin full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In\naddition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation. For\nexample, we are subject to restrictions and requirements under the DMA, including in areas such as the combination of data across services and product design,\nwhich will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement.\nThe FTC initiated an administrative proceeding against us alleging, among other things, deficient compliance with the FTC consent order and seeking\nsubstantial modifications to the requirements of the consent order, including a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to\nthe composition of our board of directors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products.

There also have\nbeen, and continue to be, various other litigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the\nprotections under Section 230, as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user access and content, counterfeit\ngoods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change.

For example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to\nsteal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical\nlimitations within the software and hardware on which we rely, or human error in using such systems, have led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes\nincluding a negative experience or other adverse effects for users and marketers who use our products, compromised ability of our products to perform in a\nmanner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or enhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing errors,\ncompromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property or other data, or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our\nservices. For example, we make commitments to our users as to how their data will be collected, used, shared, and retained within and across our products, and\nour systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, bugs,\nvulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our\nsystems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have led to, and may in the future lead to,\noutcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or\nother remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be\nadversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and\nthird parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our\nproprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, and\nwe currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications\nfrom third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and\npending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every\ncountry in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order\nto prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that\nothers will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In addition, we regularly contribute software\nsource code under open source and other permissive licenses and have made other technology we developed available under such licenses, and we include open\nsource software in our products. Additionally, our AI is trained on data sets that may include open source software and the outputs of our AI may be subject to\nopen source license restrictions or obligations. As a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be\nrequired to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the\nprotection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible\nassets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations.

are\nexpensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently\nenter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-\npracticing entities\" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from\ntechnology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed,\nor introduce new features for existing products, which could increase our exposure to intellectual property claims from competitors, non-practicing entities, and\nother rights holders.\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent, copyright, and trademark holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services,\ntrademarks, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face\nincreasing competition and develop new products and services, we expect the number of intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending intellectual\nproperty litigation is often costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final\noutcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any\nsuch litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to change or cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits\nand disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable\njudgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to change or cease some or all of our operations or\npay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights,\nwhich may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required\nto develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices, or branding or discontinue the practices or branding. The development of alternative non-\ninfringing technology, branding or practices could require significant effort and expense, could result in less effective technology, branding or practices or\notherwise negatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past,\nand our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation\nreferred to above.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\n", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3534, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "795fa3f5-4ba3-4b27-bcee-f2909aeadc78": {"__data__": {"id_": "795fa3f5-4ba3-4b27-bcee-f2909aeadc78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f089f9d4-2a15-4d96-97d5-72a714488f2e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "927ff7339a00d12efbdfc0ead2e0d9e779322683a8f6920464932836235617cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b77ac002-29fc-4ba8-be8e-c49b5da13357", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "e9498b8c49e2e199a56a611f49ffc2adea23cf454201c3ba75a89acbda7ebe43", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8b8f1556-b4dd-4ec9-a42d-f52aadf8ba94", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "57f06cdee32565ad8605d0de60332acda71c76c632ed56b808fd9c9d3f934d56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile.

Our industry is prone to cybersecurity threats and\nattacks, and we regularly experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees. We believe we are a particularly attractive target as a result of our prominence\nand scale, the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services. Our products and services\nreach billions of users and involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. In addition, our business and operations span\nnumerous geographies around the world, involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties, and rely on\nsoftware and hardware that is highly technical and complex. We maintain an information security program that is comprised of policies and controls designed\nto mitigate cybersecurity risk. However, at any given time, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we\ndiscover vulnerabilities in our program. We continuously work to enhance our information security program and risk management efforts.\nWe use a risk management framework based on applicable laws and regulations, and informed by industry standards and industry-recognized practices,\nfor managing cybersecurity risks within our products and services, infrastructure, and corporate resources. To identify and assess risks from cybersecurity\nthreats, we evaluate a variety of developments including threat intelligence, first- and third-party vulnerabilities, evolving regulatory requirements, and\nobserved cybersecurity incidents, among others. We regularly conduct risk assessments to evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of our systems and processes\nin addressing cybersecurity threats and to identify any areas for remediation and opportunities for enhancements. We also engage third-party security experts\nand consultants to assist with assessment and enhancement of our cybersecurity risk management processes, as well as benchmarking against industry\npractices. In addition, we maintain a privacy risk management program to assess privacy risks related to how we are collecting, using, sharing, and storing user\ndata, which is subject to assessment by an independent, third-party privacy assessor. Our internal audit function provides independent assessment and assurance\non the overall operations of our cybersecurity and privacy programs and the supporting control frameworks. These processes support informed risk-based\ndecision-making and prioritization of cybersecurity countermeasures and risk mitigation strategies.

With\nrespect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several\nof the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (In re\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the\nconsolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for\na payment of $725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. In addition,\nour platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement\nand modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly\nenhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other\njurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of\nChancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data\npractices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery\nCourt action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our\nhistorical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder\nderivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation. On January 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was\ndenied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed as to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the\nbreach of fiduciary duty claims.\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding (In the Matter of Facebook, Inc.), seeking substantial changes to the modified consent\norder, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a\nproposed order and include, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of\ndirectors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products.

On July 4, 2023, the CJEU\nissued a decision which in particular made it more difficult to rely on \"legitimate interests,\" and \"contractual necessity\" as opposed to user \"consent,\" as a legal\nbasis for data processing under the GDPR for ads and personalization purposes.\nThe result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our\nbusiness practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely\naffect our business.\nSecurities and Other Actions\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and\nelsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of\nour terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court\nin the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of California (In Re Facebook, Inc. Securities Litigation) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our\nplatform and user data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims. On January 17,\n2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued\nits decision affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning\nin September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company\ndocuments concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and\nother undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on\nOctober 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us\nand certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the same\nmatters, and seeking unspecified damages.

Our\nadvertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targeting\nand measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.\nIn particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including its evolving interpretation through\ndecisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive, the European Digital Services Act, and U.S. ", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3447, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10d54e5b-22dc-42e1-94bf-9eec785977b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "10d54e5b-22dc-42e1-94bf-9eec785977b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "18d11a43-be36-48b8-899b-71dd607d6556", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "c57d85677e95be3d06b2f8777e384c870fa33019f079acb24e98ac475b541e2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "25ca790c-7afb-47dd-be59-cc4f9b22c726", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "b78f5acfb594a17fa22e00496d5dec848ae923f2bd517baae706531edac36145", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a477f77c-9170-4caf-9712-5f43e5015214", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "77c3acf5a1ae72257a614e15be002b0649a481973ff59d81833be458f5b3a05b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "state privacy laws including the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and we\nexpect these and other\n61", "start_char_idx": 3447, "end_char_idx": 3660, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a477f77c-9170-4caf-9712-5f43e5015214": {"__data__": {"id_": "a477f77c-9170-4caf-9712-5f43e5015214", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "583509c8-877b-42ae-a833-7fb20c83e5ef", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "c685c92a688d3f8540b69058295cecad6dcd1816aef39e31af5ddb532ba86717", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "10d54e5b-22dc-42e1-94bf-9eec785977b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "eb63761736c03cacdaddcddd66b717f1d1387fa198de5c8788fefb4b7c49d0b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "59b0d1f9-2055-442a-ac23-8b71dde34aae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef77cc18a94612888a23bc51f5e1cecd157e951606333cb0c877fe55ae38f14c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\ndevelopments such as the Digital Markets Act will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement,\nwhether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. For example,\nin response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in\nthe EU, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\"\nalternative. We are continuing to engage with regulators on our new consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple\nand Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use\nthese signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with\nchanges to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we\nexpect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.\nTo mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are\ndeveloping privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we\nprocess, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data\ninto our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools\nto help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad\nproducts. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery,\ntargeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new\nfeatures and scaling existing features.\nWe are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for\nadvertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers.\nHowever, we expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described above will\ncontinue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\nOther Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our\nuser growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as\ninflation, rising interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. While we saw improvement in business and\nmacroeconomic conditions in 2023, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which could impact our financial results in\nfuture periods.

Our FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to\ndevelop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI initiatives, including to recommend relevant content across\nour products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI.\nWe are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices, software for\nsocial platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies for the metaverse.

While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs\nused in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue from users\nwho are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents\nthe substantial majority of our total revenue.

The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average\nrates.

We believe that the estimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when applicable, have the\ngreatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For further information\non all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 \u2014 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.\nCertain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any\nfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we\nevaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the\namount can be reasonably estimated.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\nrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our\ndefenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is\nrequired to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and\nunasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated\ninformation available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations\nregarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted\nagainst us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the Irish Data\nProtection Commission, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of\nan inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be\nrevised in future quarters.\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonably\npossible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of\nmanagement's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome\nbecomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.

These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that\nhave been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and\ndevelopment tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits\nwill be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide\nno assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, as significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our\nprovision for income taxes. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances\nchange, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts\nrecorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on\nour financial condition and operating results.\nValuation of Assets\nThe valuation and impairment assessment of certain assets, including recoverability, requires significant judgment and assumptions such as estimation of\nfuture cash flows, discount rates, market data of comparable assets and companies, holding period and residual value of asset groups, among others.\nImpairment testing for long-lived-assets, including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, occurs whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable compared to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected\nto generate from the use and eventual disposition. The impairment test is performed at the asset group level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the test results indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the\ncarrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\nImpairment testing for non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative, is\nperformed at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. Such qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not\nlimited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment;\noperational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair\nvalue of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in our consolidated\nstatements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. In addition, for these non-marketable equity securities, determining whether a\nnon-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the non-marketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of\ndifferences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b)\nadjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most\nadvantageous markets. The identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies,\nwhich may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place.

In 2023, the number of ads delivered increased by 28%, as compared with an 18% increase in 2022 as ads impressions\ngrew in all regions during 2023, especially in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The increase in the ads delivered during 2023 was driven by increases in the\nnumber and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users. In 2023, the average price per ad decreased by 9%, as compared with a\ndecrease of 16% in 2022. The decrease in average price per ad was driven by an increase in the number of ads delivered, especially in geographies and in\nproducts, such as Reels, that monetize at lower rates. While the average price per ad declined year-over-year, we believe the improvements to our ad targeting\nand measurement tools have had a favorable impact on our ad performance and advertising demand. Other factors are also discussed in the section entitled \"\u2014\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2023 Results.\" In addition, year-over-year advertising revenue growth for the full year 2023 was driven mainly by marketer\nspending in online commerce, which benefited from marketers based in China, consumer packaged goods, and entertainment and media. We anticipate that\nfuture advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered.\nOther revenue\nFoA other revenue in 2023 increased $250 million, or 31%, compared to 2022. The increase was mainly driven by WhatsApp Business Platform\nrevenue.\nReality Labs\nRL revenue in 2023 decreased $263 million, or 12%, compared to 2022. The decrease in RL revenue was mostly driven by a net decrease in the volume\nof Meta Quest sales.\nRevenue Seasonality\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality in\nboth advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third\nand fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 17%, 16%, and 16% between the\nthird and fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021 declined 11%, 17%, and 7%\ncompared to the fourth quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.\n75", "start_char_idx": 598, "end_char_idx": 3157, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6faa2c7-2d72-463c-ba98-464cfee8794d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6faa2c7-2d72-463c-ba98-464cfee8794d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12ed3d1f-3a5c-4ae2-bdf5-2ee67b1b0e70", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "1cc5a32019db94744857c4c56ed76b0fed3eefb36f9312ab638b5cb07c3343d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f41f66d2-7ae2-470d-ad60-c05209703b9d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "9d44b4cfaaff92a798e935d514a7a7960dd79051b21628e88a489cf752440a8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9539453a-0608-4395-8db2-c1e366dbfe0a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "df2da76be8dba83a791ee5c3f71b4b24103a81804c3c0e3e7fc51d19b53d85f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue\nChanges in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our total revenue in the full year 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.

For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is\naccepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to\ndate.\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period.

RSUs granted to employees are measured based on\nthe grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the\nstraight-line basis over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for\nincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.\nUnder this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial\nreporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax\nrates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the\ndeferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider\nall available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable\nincome and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a\ncomponent of the provision for income taxes.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated statements of income. We incurred\nadvertising expenses of $2.02 billion, $2.65 billion, and $2.99 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nEmployee Severance\nWe recognize one-time employee termination costs when notification occurs, based on the regional requirements in which the employee works.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with financial institutions globally and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less\nfrom the date of purchase.

We elected to account for\nsubstantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair\nvalue resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates.

For additional information, see Note 6 \u2014 Non-marketable Equity Securities.\nIn addition, we also held other non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value\nin the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are\nrequired to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk\nmeasurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels\nand bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2- Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\nliabilities.\nLevel 3- Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing\nthe asset or liability.\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because their fair value is derived\nfrom quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. Certain other assets are classified within Level 3\nbecause factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity.\nOur non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. When\nindicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and\nother unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts.

If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and\naccounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives\nof finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the\nrevised estimated useful life.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to\nU.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and\nlosses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had\ncumulative translation losses, net of tax of $1.24 billion and $1.86 billion, respectively.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved\nare recorded within interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions\nwere $366 million, $81 million, and $140 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nCredit Risk and Concentration\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash,\nmarketable securities, and accounts receivable.

Earnings per Share\nWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method.

For\nthe calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including restricted stock units (RSUs) awards under our\nEquity Incentive Plan.\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A common\nstock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed by\ndividing the resulting net income by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 16 million and 95 million shares of Class A common stock equivalents of RSUs were\nexcluded from the diluted EPS calculation, respectively, as including them would have an anti-dilutive effect.

The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a\nproposed order and include, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of\ndirectors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for\nthe District of Columbia (USA v. Facebook, Inc.) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On\nNovember 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (U.S. v.\nFacebook, Inc.) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. On January 12, 2024, the district court denied our motion for a stay\npending appeal and, on January 25, 2024, we filed a motion for a stay pending appeal before the Court of Appeals. On November 29, 2023, we separately filed\na complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC), asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the\nFTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our\nmotion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. Oral argument on our motion to enjoin and the FTC\u2019s motion to dismiss is scheduled\nfor March 1, 2024. If the FTC proceeding is not enjoined or stayed, our response in the proceeding will be due on March 15, 2024, after which time the FTC\ncould amend the order to impose these additional requirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision\nmodifying the order and could request the appellate court to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is unclear\nwhether the appeal or the request for a stay would be successful.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators\nregarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms\nIreland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance\nwith the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR \u20ac1.2 billion as well as corrective orders, which is described further in \"Legal Proceedings\"\ncontained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the Court of\nJustice of the European Union, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the\nGDPR's cooperation and consistency mechanisms, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the\ninterpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty.\nAlthough we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related to these inquiries and\ninvestigations in Europe, and we believe there is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be material\nindividually or in the aggregate.\nOn February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court (Texas v. Meta Platforms, Inc.) alleging that \"tag suggestions\" and\nother uses of facial recognition technology violated the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer\nProtection Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in June 2024.\nBeginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly received individuals' information from\nthird-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our terms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive\nrelief (for example, In re Meta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v.

Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States and in the\nUnited Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged\nanticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States\nwere consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Klein et al., v. Meta Platforms, Inc.). On January 14, 2022, the court\ngranted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the\nputative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated\ncomplaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. In December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of\nObjections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules.\nSecurities and Other Actions\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and\nelsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of\nour terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court\nin the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of California (In Re Facebook, Inc. Securities Litigation) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our\nplatform and user data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims. On January 17,\n2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued\nits decision affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning\nin September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company\ndocuments concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and\nother undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on\nOctober 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us\nand certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the same\nmatters, and seeking unspecified damages.

These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of\nthe claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation\nand bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification\nclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.

Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by our board of directors, subject to\nthe rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to\none vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes.

We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2017 through 2019 tax\nyears. Our 2014 through 2016 tax years are with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals for certain unresolved issues. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years\nremain open to examination by the IRS and the Irish Revenue Commissioners.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\nwith the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years\nsubsequent to 2010 and has done so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a\npetition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an\nadjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was\ncompleted in August 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2024. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its\nupdated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the\namounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its\nposition from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and\ncertain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to\napproximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the\npositions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), that is lower than\nthe potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails\nin its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax\nthat we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2023, we have not\nresolved these matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax\nitems that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is\nreasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining\nthat are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.

Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31,\n2023, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we\nare required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under\nthe Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the\nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public\naccounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of\nthe Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In\naddition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints\nand that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nItem 9B.Other Information\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nOn November 30, 2023, Jennifer Newstead, our Chief Legal Officer, entered into a trading plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of\nRule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The description is intended as a summary, and is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, copies of which have been filed as exhibits to this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 9,241,000,000 shares, consisting of: (i) 5,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, $0.000006 par value per\nshare; (ii) 4,141,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, $0.000006 par value per share; and (iii) 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.000006 par value\nper share.\nCommon Stock\nDividend Rights\nSubject to preferences that may apply to shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of our common stock are\nentitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available if our board of directors, in its discretion, determines to issue dividends and only then at the times\nand in the amounts that our board of directors may determine.\nVoting Rights\nThe holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share, and holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share.\nThe holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class, unless otherwise required by law. Delaware law could\nrequire either holders of our Class A common stock or our Class B common stock to vote separately as a single class in the following circumstances:\n\u2022if we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of a class of stock, or to\nincrease or decrease the par value of a class of stock, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment; and\n\u2022if we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in a manner that alters or changes the powers, preferences or special\nrights of a class of stock in a manner that affected its holders adversely, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed\namendment.\nStockholders do not have the ability to cumulate votes for the election of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and\nrestated bylaws provide for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size, each serving staggered three-year terms,\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock.

Any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a\nmajority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class until such time as shares of our Class B common stock represent less than\nthirty-five percent (35%) of the combined voting power of our common stock. This provision could delay or prevent the approval of a change in control\nthat might otherwise be approved by a majority of outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock voting together on a combined basis.\n\u2022Dual Class Stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mark\nZuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant\ncorporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets.\n\u2022Supermajority Approvals.

This will have the effect of making it more difficult to amend our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation or amended and restated bylaws to remove or modify certain provisions.\n\u2022Board of Directors Vacancies. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that stockholders may\nfill vacant directorships. When the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of\ncommon stock, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws authorize only our board of directors to fill vacant\ndirectorships.
