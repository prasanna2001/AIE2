The description is intended as a summary, and is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, copies of which have been filed as exhibits to this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 9,241,000,000 shares, consisting of: (i) 5,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, $0.000006 par value per\nshare; (ii) 4,141,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, $0.000006 par value per share; and (iii) 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.000006 par value\nper share.\nCommon Stock\nDividend Rights\nSubject to preferences that may apply to shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of our common stock are\nentitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available if our board of directors, in its discretion, determines to issue dividends and only then at the times\nand in the amounts that our board of directors may determine.\nVoting Rights\nThe holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share, and holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share.\nThe holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class, unless otherwise required by law. Delaware law could\nrequire either holders of our Class A common stock or our Class B common stock to vote separately as a single class in the following circumstances:\n\u2022if we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of a class of stock, or to\nincrease or decrease the par value of a class of stock, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment; and\n\u2022if we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in a manner that alters or changes the powers, preferences or special\nrights of a class of stock in a manner that affected its holders adversely, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed\namendment.\nStockholders do not have the ability to cumulate votes for the election of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and\nrestated bylaws provide for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size, each serving staggered three-year terms,\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock. Our directors will be\nassigned by the then-current board of directors to a class when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the\ncombined voting power of common stock.\nNo Preemptive or Similar Rights\nOur common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions.\n1Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions\nUpon our dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders\nof our common stock, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights and payment of liquidation preferences, if\nany, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock.\nConversion\nThe outstanding shares of Class B common stock are convertible at any time as follows: (1) at the option of the holder, a share of Class B common stock\nmay be converted at any time into one share of Class A common stock or (2) upon the election of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of\nClass B common stock, all outstanding shares of Class B common stock may be converted into shares of Class A common stock. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value, except for certain\ntransfers described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including transfers to family members, trusts solely for the benefit of the\nstockholder or their family members, and partnerships, corporations, and other entities exclusively owned by the stockholder or their family members.

Once\nconverted or transferred and converted into Class A common stock, the Class B common stock will not be reissued.\nPreferred Stock\nSubject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time\nto time the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and any of its\nqualifications, limitations or restrictions. Our board of directors also can increase or decrease the number of shares of any series, but not below the number of\nshares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred\nstock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of\npreferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nSo long as the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, Mark Zuckerberg\nwill effectively control all matters submitted to our stockholders for a vote, as well as the overall management and direction of our company, which will have\nthe effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another person from acquiring control of our company.\nAfter such time as the shares of our Class B common stock no longer represent a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, the\nprovisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying,\ndeferring or discouraging another person from acquiring control of our company.\nDelaware Law\nA Delaware corporation may \u201copt out\u201d of these provisions with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or an express provision in its\ncertificate of incorporation or bylaws resulting from a stockholders\u2019 amendment approved by at least a majority of the outstanding voting shares. We have\nexpressly elected not to be governed by the business combination provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\n2Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of\ndeterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control of our company, even after such time as the shares of our Class B common stock no\nlonger represent a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, including the following:\n\u2022Separate Class B Vote for Certain Transactions. Any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a\nmajority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class until such time as shares of our Class B common stock represent less than\nthirty-five percent (35%) of the combined voting power of our common stock.

However, when the outstanding shares of our Class B\ncommon stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate\nof incorporation or amended and restated bylaws by stockholders will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding\nshares of Class A and Class B common stock. This will have the effect of making it more difficult to amend our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation or amended and restated bylaws to remove or modify certain provisions.\n\u2022Board of Directors Vacancies. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that stockholders may\nfill vacant directorships. When the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of\ncommon stock, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws authorize only our board of directors to fill vacant\ndirectorships. In addition, the number of directors constituting our board of directors is set only by resolution adopted by a majority vote of our entire\nboard of directors. These provisions restricting the filling of vacancies will prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of our board of directors and\ngaining control of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees.\n\u2022Classified Board. Our board of directors is not classified. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws\nprovide that when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, our\nboard of directors will be classified into three classes of directors each of which will hold office for a three-year term. In addition, thereafter, directors may\nonly be removed from the board of directors for cause. The existence of a classified board could delay a successful tender offeror from obtaining majority\ncontrol of our board of directors, and the prospect of that delay might deter a potential offeror.\n\u2022Stockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders will be able to\ntake action by written consent. When the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of\ncommon stock, our stockholders will no longer be able to take action by written consent, and will only be able to take action at annual or special meetings\nof our stockholders. Stockholders will not be permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors. Our amended and restated bylaws further\nprovide that special meetings of our\n3stockholders may be called only by a majority of our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or our president.\n\u2022Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations. Our amended and restated bylaws provide advance notice\nprocedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at any\nmeeting of stockholders. Our amended and restated bylaws also specify certain requirements regarding the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice.\nThese provisions may preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for\ndirectors at our meetings of stockholders.\n\u2022Issuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock.

stock price or total shareholder return (or the\nderivative measure thereof) upon which such Covered Compensation was received.(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company\u2019s obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not dependent on (i) if or when the\nrestated financial statements are filed or (ii) any fault of any Covered Executive for the accounting errors or other actions leading to a Financial Restatement.\n(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 2(a) through (c) hereof, the Company shall not be required to recover any Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation if both (x) the conditions set forth in either of the following clauses (i) or (ii) are satisfied and (y) the Committee (or a majority of the\nindependent directors serving on the Board)

reasonable attempt(s) to make such recovery and provide\nthat documentation to the Nasdaq;\n(ii) recovery of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified

We report our estimates of the\nnumbers of our daily active people (DAP), monthly active people (MAP), and average revenue per person (ARPP) (collectively, our \"Family metrics\") based\non the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) during the\napplicable period of measurement. We have historically reported the numbers of our daily active users (DAUs), monthly active users (MAUs), and average\nrevenue per user (ARPU) (collectively, our \"Facebook metrics\") based on user activity only on Facebook and Messenger and not on our other products. We\nbelieve our Family metrics better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our products. Beginning with our\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed for the first quarter of 2024, we will no longer report DAUs, MAUs, ARPU, and MAP in our periodic reports filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, but will continue reporting DAP and ARPP (calculated based on DAP).\nWhile these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are\ninherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these\nmetrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our\nestimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for\ncalculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in\nadjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to\napply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or\nadjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology\nor other factors such as data limitations or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our Family metrics estimates in\nsome instances exceed estimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\nFamily Metrics\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual\nproduct. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not\nreflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex\ntechniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user\naccounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of\naccounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are\nsubject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which itself is\nsubject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people,\nand it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error\nmargins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews\nof limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5077, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8f0c6a3-766a-47fa-a983-a78e2631e6f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8f0c6a3-766a-47fa-a983-a78e2631e6f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "916ed6a4-7e7c-4b4a-9b0d-a8f20e4521dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "9794bb794a3343c2771870a1d9c3b7682c9eb3e9cb43c2f10b75b77ec4a316ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "74e1373e-9d0f-416c-b2e3-9d2e058cb073", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "768403ce33ce29a5150c111acaffb219e67fcecaef52611db8958033fa0c260e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d7f3b1f-6e3a-4642-b52d-8c2d5f34a868", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba090a6888386d379f662bdafcf7caa5ebba870dcc893d470e5a2ee7dcb72bde", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which itself is\nsubject to error as well.

For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on\nphone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our\nprocess for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or\nlegislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics\nat all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies,\nproduct changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across\nour products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating\naccounts (as defined below).\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\"\naccounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of\n2023, we estimated that approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a\nlimited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors\nassociated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due\nto encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts\nestimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make\nproduct changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP estimates in a\nparticular period. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary\nsignificantly from our estimates.\nThe numbers of Family DAP and MAP discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as ARPP, do not include users on our other products,\nunless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products.\nFacebook Metrics\nWe regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among our MAUs. A duplicate account is one\nthat a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide \"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users\nhave created personal profiles for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than\na personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that\nviolate our terms of service, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of\naccounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP\naddresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the\nreviewers. Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile\nplatforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts.\nOur estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may\nallow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users.

We build technology that helps people connect and\nshare, find communities, and grow businesses. Our products enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal\ncomputers, virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) headsets, and wearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world\naround them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with audiences ranging from their closest family members\nand friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward\nimmersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the metaverse, which we believe is the next evolution in social technology. Our vision\nfor the metaverse does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in\nthe very early stages of its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction. Across our work, we are\ninnovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful, and immersive.\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from\nselling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a\nrange of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content.\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2024, we intend to focus on six key investment areas: AI, the metaverse, our discovery\nengine, monetization of our products and services, regulatory readiness, and enhancing developer efficiency to build, iterate, and optimize products quickly.\nOur AI investments support initiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery engine that\nrecommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences, and the tools that make our\nproduct development more efficient and productive.\nThe majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2023, 80% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in\nFoA and 20% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $70.13 billion in 2023 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical\ninfrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts,\nincluding developing virtual and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our total RL\ninvestments were $18.02 billion in 2023 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are fundamentally\nnew technologies that we expect will evolve as the metaverse ecosystem develops, and many products for the metaverse may only be fully realized in the next\ndecade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the metaverse ecosystem will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a\nloss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We\nexpect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will\nunlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.\nFamily of Apps Products\n\u2022 Facebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.

For example, Meta\nHorizon Worlds is a social platform where people can interact with friends, meet new people, play games, and attend virtual events.\nTo drive greater adoption and acceptance of VR we have also introduced MR capabilities, which allow users to experience the immersion and presence\nof VR while still being grounded in the physical world, through our Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 3 devices.\nWe have continued to advance our augmented reality (AR) roadmap to include offerings such as the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which feature Meta\nAI, our advanced conversational assistant, as well as offer the ability to livestream video and let people stay more present through hands-free interaction. We\nalso offer Meta Spark, a platform that allows creators and businesses to build AR experiences that bring the digital and physical worlds together in our apps.\nIn general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the metaverse, our VR and social platform efforts also include\nnotable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to go to market, whereas our AR efforts are primarily directed toward longer-term\nresearch and development projects. For example, in 2024, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating expenses on our AR initiatives,\napproximately 40% on our VR (including MR) initiatives, and approximately 10% on social platforms and other initiatives. We apply significant judgment in\nestimating this expense breakdown as there are certain shared costs across product lines, and our expectations are subject to change, including as the metaverse\necosystem and our business strategies evolve. In particular, we regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of\nthe technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies providing connection, sharing,\ndiscovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or\ndevelop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but\nnot limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content and information online or\n8", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4659, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44ac0300-f386-409f-8d49-423948720a2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "44ac0300-f386-409f-8d49-423948720a2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e604621-e714-4192-981b-d85084eff33d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "6f293513ed7372f6d02dd1dbd5b0c31f1a14df65c2c3edd2f24aea6c273e4ca0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f0133db-73fc-48b0-858f-e648abe0be53", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "cc02c349acebf8e28f99dc8cc56d30d3c91e2caac387a4cfc2daf90f81183fe2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "098ce0a7-a26c-4317-93c2-af54ebbc1a38", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bf879cb65be2801be74bcbe5f28cde39988452a3728f24da3cb96778517d4b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nenable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences.

We also\nexpect to face additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products\nand services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse or innovate through the development and application of new technologies such as AI.\nTechnology\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means that\nour products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with\nproducts like video, VR, and MR increases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We have designed\nand built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure, and a substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is also provided by third\nparties. Our ability to provide and continue to innovate our products and services depends on the continued availability of components, power, and network\ncapacity.\nWe make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers\nand developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen\nour systems against abuse. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things,\nrecommend relevant content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, enhance our advertising tools and improve our ad delivery,\ntargeting, and measurement capabilities, and to develop new products as well as new features for existing products.\nSales and Operations\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force that\nis focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-\nmaking to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers.\nWe operate offices in approximately 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to\nprovide direct customer support to our users and partners.\nFor our RL products, our sales and operations efforts utilize third-party sales channels such as retailers, resellers, and our direct-to-consumer channel,\nMeta.com. These efforts are focused on driving consumer and enterprise sales and adoption of our Meta Quest portfolio of products and Ray-Ban Meta smart\nglasses.\nMarketing\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them, supported by internal efforts to\nstimulate awareness and interest.

These laws and regulations involve matters including\nprivacy, data use, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content,\nintegrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, AI\nand machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility,\ntelecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law\ncompliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and other\nlaws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States, and create the potential for significant fines to be\nimposed.\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to\ngovernment entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws\nand regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or\nlitigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in\nvarious ways, including for advertising, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, could adversely affect our financial results,\nincluding by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court\nheard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act\n(Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various efforts to\nremove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230, and any such changes may increase our costs or require\nsignificant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain\ndata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services.\nIf we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products\nand services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely\naffect our financial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United\nStates, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such\ndata, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, although the CJEU upheld the\nvalidity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the Irish Data Protection\nCommittee (IDPC) issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic\nArea (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine\nof EUR \u20ac1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into\ncompliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the United States.

A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create considerable\nuncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which\nwould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or new legislation and regulations\ncould significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements\nunder the GDPR, and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead\nEuropean Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other\nrequirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft decisions in investigations\nby the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes\nin the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for\nnon-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations. In\naddition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on\nproducts and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act,\nand similar laws recently enacted by other states also establish certain transparency rules and create certain data privacy rights for users. Some states have also\nproposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like\ncomprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to\nall or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising business. In addition, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive and national\nimplementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes\nto our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising\nbusiness. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook\nand Instagram in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a\n\"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are continuing to engage with regulators on our new consent model, including regarding compliance with\nrequirements under the GDPR, Digital Markets Act (DMA), and EU consumer laws. These or any similar developments in the future may negatively impact\nour user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European\nUnion, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our\nbusiness. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the\ncombination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key\nrequirements will be enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies beginning in March 2024. The DMA has caused, and may in the future cause, us to\nincur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further\ninterpretation and regulatory engagement.

We are\ncommitted to fostering an enriching environment for our workforce and we are focused on supporting our people in doing the best work of their careers. We\noffer competitive compensation and a wide range of benefits, including many learning and development resources, and we work to build a diverse and\ninclusive workplace.\nBeginning in November 2022, we took a number of steps to reduce our expense base. For example, our cost reduction efforts have included scaling back\nbudgets, reducing company perks, shrinking our real estate footprint, and employee layoffs and restructurings. We make it a priority to treat outgoing\nemployees with respect and provide a generous severance package. For U.S. employees, that includes severance of 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional\nweeks for every year of service, payment for all remaining paid time off, restricted stock unit vesting through their last day on payroll, health insurance,\ncoverage of the cost of healthcare for employees and their families for six months, career services that included three months of career support with an external\nvendor and early access to unpublished job leads, immigration support that included dedicated immigration specialists to help guide employees based on their\nneeds. We offer similar support for outgoing employees outside of the United States while taking into account local employment laws.\nEmployee Learning and Development\nWe value our investment in growing and keeping a highly skilled workforce. We aim to provide all of our employees with regular performance reviews\ntwice a year as we believe it is an important part of how we support their growth and career development while also recognizing and rewarding their impact at\nMeta. We also offer career development opportunities and work experience programs that extend beyond the physical and virtual classroom. To do this, we\nutilize various learning modalities, such as live virtual and in-person learning experiences, on-demand e-learning, self-service resources, learning communities,\nand coaching engagements.\nThe Pulse of Our Workforce\nEach year, we conduct company-wide employee surveys to help us understand how employees feel about working at Meta and what we can do to\nimprove their experience. Our surveys help us measure company, manager, team, and personal experience over time. Further, our more frequent surveys, such\nas those that have been administered daily to an ongoing random sample of employees, allow us to measure real-time sentiment around emerging events and\ncompany changes. These surveys are designed to invite feedback and actionable suggestions, inform decisions, and drive change across the company. In 2024,\nwe expect to update our listening strategy and product capabilities, based on feedback from key groups, to further improve actionability and impact.\n12", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4738, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "017ac861-6665-446b-9fee-9f579ae13d8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "017ac861-6665-446b-9fee-9f579ae13d8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d0be832e-589a-423a-9ffb-42769aeecbdb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "e4bbf7ecc6554f2defb78cd1b1ce73838e12e5b367e24303921f30fc85d879cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c7f83b6-d51d-457b-ba18-b69a5934c9fb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "1eb2a1ec7c07182a64a8f27cd35ead82fc9bdd0dadf7ffe5f2db4f4d1298b5fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "62beb1a4-97b0-4236-a5d3-09301d4a273a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7b7f37c6a3f35973e8d2dd0f622c39bb3ffefec780184eea0762adc4e087a68b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nCompensation, Benefits, Health, and Well-being\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they can focus on our mission.

Our financial performance has been\nand will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions,\nparticularly for Facebook and Instagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user\nbase in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also\nimpacted by a number of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our\nproducts and services, as well as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic led to\nincreases and decreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to period at different points during the pandemic. In addition, in\nconnection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and these services were then prohibited by the Russian\ngovernment, which contributed to slight decreases in the size of our active user base following the onset of the war. Any future declines in the size of our active\nuser base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or\nincrease the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their\nactive user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active\nuser base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we and\nour competitors introduce new and different products and services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement,\nincluding if:\n\u2022users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\n\u2022we fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services, or make changes to\nexisting products and services, that are not favorably received;\n\u2022users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format, size, and quality\nof ads that we

Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to\nusers, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.

The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by marketers, could seriously harm our\nbusiness.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from marketers advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is common in the industry, our\nmarketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us.

Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in\nan effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they\nare not satisfied for any other reason. We have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes\nreduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we\nare unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the demand for our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and\nfinancial results may be

geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types of marketers or\nwithin particular geographies, which in turn can have broader effects in other regions (for example, the war in Ukraine and service restrictions\nimposed by the Russian government have adversely affected our advertising business in Europe and other regions, and advertiser spending also can be\nsubject to adverse effects from the Israel-Hamas war).\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The occurrence of any of these or other\nfactors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop\nadvertising with us altogether, either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results.\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals\ngenerated within our products, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have\nimpacted, and we expect will continue to impact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\nOur ad targeting and measurement tools rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals\ngenerated within our products, in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect\nour business. For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, have\nimpacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the number of users\nopting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy Directive\ncompliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Judicial and\nregulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions, such as the DMA, may require us to make additional\nchanges to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, in response to regulatory\ndevelopments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European\nEconomic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no\nads\" alternative. We are continuing to engage with regulators on our new consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR,\nDMA, and EU consumer laws.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future\nplans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple\nmade certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers'\nability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers\nare willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users\nthe ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including changes implemented in\nconnection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory frameworks.\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising\nrevenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS\nchanges beginning in 2021. If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities\nwill be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue.\n20", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4679, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d6cb95d-68c6-4f85-b668-69e07acb2822": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d6cb95d-68c6-4f85-b668-69e07acb2822", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef0c4a7d-8748-475b-b7be-85b24aa49187", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "5bf86634a40d79bba7c7e2730786d0dd7cbd8dfe724cd69418582c7878319595", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "166569f1-b8a9-412c-9f49-1ce2b44069f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "947e17f254b9912b39cd13e00b3ff20fc976f69bb9afcb57ab038a4101bb1ba9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "29b53616-edcd-491f-8280-cf14c540933f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd985bf55c7e54e55f091fdf9d8ae42d242a085994fca5858e16e39ecacd9140", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies,\nproducts, and standards that we do not control.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices.

For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability\nto provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads\neffectively, while expanding their own advertising business. In addition, in January 2024, Google began the process of phasing out third-party cookies in its\nChrome browser. We expect that any similar changes to Apple's, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and\nmeasure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work\nwell with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset\nmanufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers.

For example, we have\nimplemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which\nhas to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables\nusers to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the\nmost relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our feed display and ranking algorithms or other product features to\nimprove the user experience, and these changes have had, and may in the future have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement\nwith our products, which could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as\npart of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may\nadversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products.\nWe also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties,\nformats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement\nacross our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services\nin favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels,\nwhich we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect\nour business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\nWe may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nWe believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in\nsocial technology.

However, the metaverse may not\ndevelop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build for the metaverse is uncertain. We regularly\nevaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas\nand designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology, which\nmay enable other companies to compete more effectively than us.

Our metaverse efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business.

We believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware of and actively\nengaging with other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of\nand engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In addition, from time to time we make updates to our products\nand services to improve the user experience (including to help provide users with safe, positive, age-appropriate experiences), and these changes have had, and\nmay in the future have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products and services. In the event that users\nincreasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which\ncase our business would likely be harmed.\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching\nand successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive\nadvantage against us in areas where we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads;\nby imposing fees or other charges related to our applications or our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it\nmore difficult to communicate with our users; or by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device\noperating systems, search engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated competitive products with iOS\nand Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to iOS that limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to\ntarget and measure ads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue\nat the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in\nresponse to competitive threats, but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial\nresults.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n\u2022the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors' products;\n\u2022the size and composition of our user base;\n\u2022the engagement of users with our products and competing products;\n\u2022our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\n\u2022the timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors' products;\n25", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5118, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b31fe6c-59fd-45e0-a0f2-8ab4dff186c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b31fe6c-59fd-45e0-a0f2-8ab4dff186c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6bf410a7-0754-47d1-8f3d-390febe7f609", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "1314200240ba108da9c6bec5ef7a1f9d96e65ca1357998378127a099257e03f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2b2d3573-d1ed-4ff1-bad0-7b6f24fb5293", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "bae6af2c7786790ea283f3037c81aa6ac412be1b831cb882e72b673c74d26126", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "af47e94e-5a23-43b2-948a-421df0faf2a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8441063aacc3e8d6613887b815a0c18f065acb8a3da8ce49868017f2fa835c63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\n\u2022our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data;\n\u2022our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\n\u2022our ability to monetize our products;\n\u2022the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\n\u2022customer service and support efforts;\n\u2022marketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their\ninvestments;\n\u2022our ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building applications that integrate with our products;\n\u2022our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with our products;\n\u2022changes mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;\n\u2022acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\n\u2022our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and product managers;\n\u2022our ability to cost-effectively manage our operations; and\n\u2022our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad impressions may decrease, we may become\nless attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future.

In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of\nour user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these\nmetrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our\nhistorical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different\nmethodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that\nare within the error margins disclosed below.\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology\nor other factors such as data limitations or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our Family metrics estimates in\nsome instances exceed estimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual\nproduct. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not\nreflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex\ntechniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user\naccounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of\naccounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are\nsubject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which itself is\nsubject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be\napproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people,\nand it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error\nmargins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews\nof limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these\nestimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information,\nIP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which\nare inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our\nreported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the\nrisk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited\ndata signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from\nWhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products.\nAny loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party\nbrowser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics,\nas well as our ability to report these metrics at all.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5097, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b73c9e6e-b4b2-4a80-a175-136f466ee1c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b73c9e6e-b4b2-4a80-a175-136f466ee1c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "563984f2-6bbf-425b-8e1d-3f0796de3a20", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "d5c0257244c61b50f5bb8b2fb9bf8b5c394c71e8b23ff80731cfff2b3bd675d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "57688821-f23a-405e-b743-a2c22704c3be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "7e6467ddc9926bf5c1cc59c38703ddb15d202d89ed22d6448d5307f0dc46e3a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e229d3fb-de58-4ec8-be8e-87e734fe34fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "351faac2efdebe0ed002c93147150122839194c87d1e061aa304c6c5a7ee7fdf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the\nrisk of error for our Family metrics estimates.

For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP\naddresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the\nreviewers. Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile\nplatforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts.\nOur estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may\nallow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate and\nfalse accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our\nestimates.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 10% of our worldwide MAUs. We believe the\npercentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 4% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false\naccounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as\nIndonesia, Vietnam, and Nigeria. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of\nduplicate or false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period.\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline in\nusage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age.\nAccordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete.\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-\ndisclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from\nthe location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also\nsusceptible to algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our\nads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our\nsystems, and human error.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4859, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ec10b6e-30c7-4db2-880e-a1c1d8361eaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ec10b6e-30c7-4db2-880e-a1c1d8361eaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da12ae42-decd-46f2-b30e-6bca00db7f54", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "a22e35de88275601a5b29d017ccc496a16ed183c5920b0b5137cb5343b3bd0e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e229d3fb-de58-4ec8-be8e-87e734fe34fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "15554a7f87be926e7b6ef9b71141154f0a31d5366034e10b55d4906cd6fa35c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "12f4425a-df71-47ec-9c25-f2cfdd6c8a96", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "adc5d11ed82ca7e61ad28def963dbe540062cc9f1ce6abe9be98553fada84b76", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-\ndisclosed location.

The scale of our business and breadth of\nour products create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users,\nmarketers, developers, and other third parties, and maintaining information technology systems and internal controls and procedures that support the scale and\ncomplexity of our business. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation, so\nour management may not be able to manage our scale effectively. To effectively manage our scale, we must maintain, and continue to adapt, our operational,\nfinancial, and management processes and systems, manage our headcount and facilities, and effectively train and manage our personnel. Many of our personnel\nwork remotely, which may lead to challenges in productivity and collaboration. In addition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue\ngreater efficiency and realign our business and strategic priorities. For example, in 2022 and 2023, we announced several initiatives, including restructurings,\nemployee layoffs, and measures to scale down our office facilities, but we cannot guarantee that they will achieve our intended results. These efforts also\nsubject us to risks such as greater than anticipated costs, adverse effects on employee retention, and increased difficulty managing the scale and complexity of\nour business. For example, we could face delays or challenges with product development, other business and strategic initiatives, or legal and regulatory\ncompliance, as well as other disruptions to our operations. As our organization continues to evolve, and we are required to implement and adapt complex\norganizational management structures, we may find it difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and\nlaunch new and innovative products. Any of these developments could negatively affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nWe have significant international operations, which subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that could affect our financial results.\nWe have significant international operations. We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different languages, and we have offices or data\ncenters in approximately 40 different countries. We may enter new international regions where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and\ndeploying our products. Our products are generally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain regions\ndue to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of our products are not generally available in China. We also outsource certain operational\nfunctions to third parties globally. If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are\nsubject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022political, social, or economic instability;\n\u2022risks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions,\nincluding with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade compliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual\nproperty, environmental, health and safety, licensing, and infrastructure matters;\n\u2022potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or requirements to provide user\ninformation to local authorities;\n\u2022enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different languages and countries;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\n\u2022foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the United\nStates or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently;\n\u2022higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n\u2022enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\n\u2022burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, content\n33", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4580, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f04207da-0df4-4a14-b1bb-64121953d138": {"__data__": {"id_": "f04207da-0df4-4a14-b1bb-64121953d138", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2a4ecbc-f0e8-4202-9256-d81ed88e096e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "a9ecdf9443aeb08c5dbda21d644be26bc08921311150644395787b4a47a4ed90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "12f4425a-df71-47ec-9c25-f2cfdd6c8a96", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "ea7838f42b2d30a3af484346b8172abe2a2cda369ef4ce452511172c16259901", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "be693d53-fee4-45d3-af5c-d3c1a12e931b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "18192e34c293039c00798bd8add39db3d7260916419a7cb0ae80ac2bff02bd19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nmoderation, data localization, data protection, competition, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory oversight;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with\nmultiple international locations, including difficulties arising from personnel working remotely;\n\u2022compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\n\u2022geopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes, armed conflicts, and pandemics.\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given jurisdiction and our obligations to comply\nwith laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery\nAct 2010.

For\nexample, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or\nmanufacture of the products, or from the software used in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other\nmanufacturers or suppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures to meet our customers'\nexpectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products, which subjects us to a\nnumber of risks. The manufacturing of our consumer hardware products depends on a small number of third parties, often with significant operations in a\nsingle region such as Asia. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics and the supply\nchain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development, and sales. We could be negatively affected if we are\nnot able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations\n(whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of\nsuch arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by\nmacroeconomic conditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments (including international conflicts that could result in tariffs,\nsanctions, export controls, and other measures that restrict international trade) that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain or logistics\ndisruptions.\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding\nsourcing practices and standards on labor, trade compliance, health and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their\npractices and standards.

The demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components are\nordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware products we\nmay sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition, when we\nbegin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international regions, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships,\ndetermine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may\nrequire significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial condition or results of operations and\nmay adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary\ncompanies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be\nable to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or at all,\nincluding as a result of regulatory challenges. For example, we completed our divestiture of Giphy in 2023 following the United Kingdom Competition and\nMarkets Authority's order directing us to divest Giphy post-acquisition. In addition, although we were able to successfully complete the acquisition after\nprevailing in federal court, the FTC sought to enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions or other\nstrategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance that we will realize expected synergies and potential monetization opportunities for our\nacquisitions or a favorable return on investment for our strategic investments.\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which has occurred in the past and could\nadversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness also results in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include\ncovenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we\nregularly grant restricted stock units to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results,\nand result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users,\nmarketers, developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance,\nwhich may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence\nare dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as\nwell as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or\nother strategic transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant\nadditional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these\nfactors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that\ndevelop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not manage these processes successfully.

In addition, we have faced, currently face, and will continue to face additional class action\nand other lawsuits based on claims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, copyright, user well-being, employment,\ncontingent workers, activities on our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and\nsoftware, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multiple putative class\naction suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\nviolation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well\nas other alleged anticompetitive conduct; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; the\ndisclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021; and allegations that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size for advertisements,\nresulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. We are also the subject of multiple lawsuits related to our alleged use of facial recognition\ntechnology, our alleged recommendation of and/or failure to remove harmful content, information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools, our\nalleged use of copyright-protected content to train our AI models, and allegations that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in users and\nallegations of violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with\ncertainty, and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our\nproducts or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a\nsignificant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be\nreversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which has\noccurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements,\nincluding the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our\nintercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation\nand certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are\nsubject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken,\nincluding our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could\nincrease our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flows.

For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate\nfor the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions\nin the United States or globally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued\nor such actions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have\nenacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we\noperate our business.\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting\nProject that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries\nin which we do business. As of July 2023, nearly 140 countries have approved a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions.\nAs this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax\nobligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current\ntax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or\nimpose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes\napplicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our business.\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides\npreferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state\naid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described\nabove could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position,\nresults of operations, and cash flows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts\nestimated and recorded in our financial statements.\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate has in the past varied, and may in the future vary, significantly depending on our stock price.\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation have in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, our effective tax rate,\nsometimes significantly, from period to period. In periods in which our stock price varies from the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that\nperiod, we will recognize excess tax benefits or shortfalls that will impact our effective tax rate. For example, in 2023, excess tax benefits recognized from\nshare-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $708 million and our effective income tax rate by one percentage point as compared to\nthe tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price varies in comparison to the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in\nthat period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular\nperiod will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price,\nwhich we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\n37", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5101, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8dd923d7-156f-4b22-9525-10cdeb271235": {"__data__": {"id_": "8dd923d7-156f-4b22-9525-10cdeb271235", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6e9cae4e-7105-4657-ada1-114579b55b13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "01ad998d7889546bc5fbea2f6c1e0aa12cbbaf4a61a2869c5059663333dd04c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ddb59dd-2c1d-4a41-b9fd-95c81e2e59ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "906de1c22687f14bb767e503808ff1d18027b1d6f8d3ffc7cb291e70bea5297c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b520fa36-aea9-48bc-b133-bb61b8e65e3b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "98e301677a7f2b5c2f93365ba82ee21c9cc530feba8c8df0ddf74f0838819634", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as a\ndecline in stock price and market capitalization.

For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in\nChina, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in\nviolation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from\ntime to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and\nblock access to content, and suspend user services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. Hong Kong\nis also expected to pass additional national security legislation in 2024. In addition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or\nother operations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security Law or other legislation, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were\nthen prohibited by the Russian government, which has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our revenue and business in the region.\nIt is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising, including in countries where access to our\nconsumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a small number of resellers serving advertisers\nbased in China, and it is possible that the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue, whether as a\nresult of the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take\nother action against us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nSimilarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to\nreduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or\nour other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make\nchanges to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or\ncapture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base,\nuser engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and\nour financial results could be adversely affected.\n39", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5158, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55d21a58-c31f-4901-a4a6-cf4f8f70169f": {"__data__": {"id_": "55d21a58-c31f-4901-a4a6-cf4f8f70169f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "18cbe8a7-cec2-4238-bf04-5a7f1df1979f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "1c2d510e869b4255b4de1b7317c1f60a5fdc7ea3d2dc522b3f5daa022faafbad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "df12f05a-8ff7-430e-b8bb-9cc164b3bda2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "84f4510282f28119cf2cd8f7430c8af6f0404bee4fd6fd326d53a205728f276a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1e1f5313-f46e-4ff7-846e-c4244c7ed764", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "aaf9553146288ae6b3bc61de5a70b0c973c61b37d7cff50591e7d695020e7770", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and data protection, content,\ncompetition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain\ninterpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in\nuser growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data\nuse, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity,\nintellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, AI and\nmachine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility,\ntelecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law\ncompliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or\nother actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy,\ncontent, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United\nStates, and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to\ngovernment entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws\nand regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or\nlitigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in\nvarious ways, including for advertising, could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our\nservices or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue.\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain\ndata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services.\nFor example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States,\ncalled the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other\nbases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For\nexample, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought\nby the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final\nDecision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was\nnot in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR \u20ac1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to\nsuspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including\nstorage, of such data in the United States.

As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as\nwell as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative\nimpact on our business and/or our operations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations\nimposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act\n(CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), also establishes certain transparency rules and creates certain data privacy rights for users,\nincluding limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data is shared with\nthird parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These\nlaws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers,\nhave to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws\nspecifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws\nare evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those\nstates, adversely affecting our advertising business. In Europe, regulators continue to enforce guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements\nregarding the use of cookies and similar technologies, and may impose specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such\ntechnologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products\nand include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely\naffected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans\nto change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and\nin November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are continuing to engage with regulators on our new\nconsent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. These or any similar developments in the\nfuture may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state\nlevel, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European\nUnion imposes restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and\nacquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements will be enforceable against\ndesignated gatekeeper companies beginning in March 2024. The DMA has caused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and\nmake changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory\nengagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could have similar effects.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5324, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5c2d5c4-841f-4a38-af92-e3be13a951c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5c2d5c4-841f-4a38-af92-e3be13a951c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b3995e3f-6543-4659-9d5b-81624dfe7707", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "c1834a387867666136a094f415249e52c4dac1b9bc3b60bdb5acdf308edaca8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd2a3593-1c72-4034-8689-5614aecdd71f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "518a10d359cea3be130a903ecee2610b9c25a3baaaa28239c96d6685f7af019f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "adac2761-f2e4-460b-8899-50311c84e3eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "544364d3dbed74ed0e4ffa61f70de6644369af5282cc8520e6f5d0753fb9e7f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state\nlevel, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business.

In July 2019, we entered into\na settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things, required us to significantly\nenhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other\njurisdictions remain ongoing.

In particular, we\nare maintaining a comprehensive privacy program in connection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors\noversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to\nregularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor,\nwhich has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our\nsystems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing investments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical\ninfrastructure.

In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes,\ndeceptive and fraudulent advertising, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws\nregulating hate speech or other types of content, on- or offline safety and well-being (such as acts of violence, terrorism, improper promotion or distribution of\npharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, human exploitation, child exploitation, illegal gaming, and other fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity), products liability,\nconsumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. For example, we have recently seen an increase in claims brought by younger users related to well-\nbeing issues based on allegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products. In addition, we have been subject to litigation alleging that\nour ad targeting and delivery practices constitute violations of anti-discrimination laws.\nThe potential risks relating to any of the foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our\nprotection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. For\nexample, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platform liability for copyright\ninfringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which most member states have already implemented into their national laws. In addition, the\nEuropean Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states are implementing.\nIn the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. There also have\nbeen, and continue to be, various other litigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the\nprotections under Section 230, as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user access and content, counterfeit\ngoods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We\ncould incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages.\nWe could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other judicial or government-imposed remedies as a\nresult of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted, and may result in the future, in the imposition of fines or\nother penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in\nEurope, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing liability or potentially significant\npenalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we\nhave been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey, and we have been subject to\nfines and service blocking and prohibition in Russia. Content-related legislation also has required us, and may require us in the future, to change our products\nor business practices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies. For example, the\nEuropean Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the\navailability of that content, which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes.

Depending on how our Payments products evolve, we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing\ngambling, banking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. We have received certain\npayments licenses in the United States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions for our regulated Payments-related products and activities.

Our efforts to comply with these laws and\nregulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and attention and may still not guarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to\nbe in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may\nbe required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including: increased costs and diversion of management\ntime and attention and other resources to address bad transactions or customer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers,\nemployees, or third parties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements.\nWe have also launched payments functionality on certain of our applications and may in the future undertake additional payments initiatives, including as part\nof our metaverse efforts, which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.\nRisks Related to Data, Security, Platform Integrity, and Intellectual Property\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or other cyber incidents\ncould harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or to disrupt our ability to provide service.\nOur products and services involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data.

Cyber-attacks continue to\nevolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems and processes that\nare designed to protect our data and user data, to reduce the risk of data loss or misuse, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to\nreduce the risk of or detect security breaches, such measures will not provide absolute security, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to react in a\ntimely manner to any cyber-attacks or other security incidents, or that our remediation efforts will be successful. Our business and operations span numerous\ngeographies around the world and involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties. At any given time, we\nface known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we discover vulnerabilities in our security efforts.\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads, may receive or store information\nprovided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with our products. We provide limited information to such third parties based on\nthe scope of services provided to us. However, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a\nbreach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed.\nWe regularly experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees, and we incur significant costs in protecting against or\nremediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data\nprotection, as well as obligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or\nregulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data, which has occurred in the\npast and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Such\nincidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a\nmaterial and adverse effect on our business, reputation, or financial results.\nFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user\naccess tokens, which were then used to access certain profile information from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding\nthis cyber-attack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could subject us to substantial\nfines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nIntentional misuse of our services and user data and other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform could adversely affect our business.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intentional misuse of our services and user data by third parties, as well as other undesirable,\nillicit, or high-risk activity on our platform.

Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable\njudgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to change or cease some or all of our operations or\npay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights,\nwhich may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required\nto develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices, or branding or discontinue the practices or branding. The development of alternative non-\ninfringing technology, branding or practices could require significant effort and expense, could result in less effective technology, branding or practices or\notherwise negatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past,\nand our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation\nreferred to above.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold in\nour initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $17.55 to $384.33 through December 31, 2023. In\naddition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may in the\nfuture fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable segments;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our\ncompany, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with acquisitions, or the anticipation of\nsuch sales;\n\u2022investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures,\nor capital commitments;\n48", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5038, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80ee473a-851d-4552-a1a2-ac507871463d": {"__data__": {"id_": "80ee473a-851d-4552-a1a2-ac507871463d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c34ce16e-e5ec-47cc-85ed-f7eee8c67294", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "292ad05c4695c4e62789bacea53300c186f1b91342bf9714721f8d45d77f039d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eded0664-e7e0-4b4d-85d5-a31d6a1fe931", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "927ff7339a00d12efbdfc0ead2e0d9e779322683a8f6920464932836235617cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1e3dd2b5-b0a0-4f98-8e06-f219ca1c83a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a26aed1aa8681c8f4c41d318b373c2c2eaeedbdf06a628c1e68192381c1d3939", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\n\u2022announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, the level of user engagement, or the\neffectiveness of our ad products;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including our developers and competitors;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\n\u2022media coverage of our business and financial performance;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\n\u2022adverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition, content, privacy, or other matters, including\ninterim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\n\u2022trading activity in our share repurchase program; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other disruptive external events, or responses to\nthese events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of\nequity securities of many technology companies.

We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could\nsubject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B\ncommon stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Holders of our Class B common stock,\nincluding our founder, Board Chair, and CEO, together hold a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able to\ncontrol the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all\noutstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the\nforeseeable future.\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions,\nsuch as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the\neffect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example,\nMr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control\na majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\n49", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3645, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e3dd2b5-b0a0-4f98-8e06-f219ca1c83a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e3dd2b5-b0a0-4f98-8e06-f219ca1c83a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb2fd8de-e326-466d-afb0-f809e65d80f1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "4bc5e31c1f361a8c36e40cd7b6c7f050f79d0104802598944b516646910b596e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "80ee473a-851d-4552-a1a2-ac507871463d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "292ad05c4695c4e62789bacea53300c186f1b91342bf9714721f8d45d77f039d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b1bcd912-60b3-4d8b-aaf3-9aa8e9cf8c59", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fd4f208b392a531d044eef5c52d95ddcde27901e4cbd19f5bbd61179b7be16a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority\nof our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function.

Our industry is prone to cybersecurity threats and\nattacks, and we regularly experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees. We believe we are a particularly attractive target as a result of our prominence\nand scale, the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services. Our products and services\nreach billions of users and involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. In addition, our business and operations span\nnumerous geographies around the world, involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties, and rely on\nsoftware and hardware that is highly technical and complex. We maintain an information security program that is comprised of policies and controls designed\nto mitigate cybersecurity risk. However, at any given time, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we\ndiscover vulnerabilities in our program. We continuously work to enhance our information security program and risk management efforts.\nWe use a risk management framework based on applicable laws and regulations, and informed by industry standards and industry-recognized practices,\nfor managing cybersecurity risks within our products and services, infrastructure, and corporate resources. To identify and assess risks from cybersecurity\nthreats, we evaluate a variety of developments including threat intelligence, first- and third-party vulnerabilities, evolving regulatory requirements, and\nobserved cybersecurity incidents, among others. We regularly conduct risk assessments to evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of our systems and processes\nin addressing cybersecurity threats and to identify any areas for remediation and opportunities for enhancements. We also engage third-party security experts\nand consultants to assist with assessment and enhancement of our cybersecurity risk management processes, as well as benchmarking against industry\npractices. In addition, we maintain a privacy risk management program to assess privacy risks related to how we are collecting, using, sharing, and storing user\ndata, which is subject to assessment by an independent, third-party privacy assessor. Our internal audit function provides independent assessment and assurance\non the overall operations of our cybersecurity and privacy programs and the supporting control frameworks. These processes support informed risk-based\ndecision-making and prioritization of cybersecurity countermeasures and risk mitigation strategies. Our risk mitigation strategies include a broad variety of\ntechnical and operational measures, as well as annual cybersecurity and privacy training for all of our employees.\nIn addition, we maintain specific policies and practices governing our third-party security risks, including our third-party assessment (TPA) process.\nUnder our TPA process, we gather information from certain third parties who contract with Meta and share or receive data, or have access to or integrate with\nour systems, in order to help us assess potential risks associated with their security controls. We also generally require third parties to, among other things,\nmaintain security controls to protect our confidential information and data, and notify us of material data breaches that may impact our data.\nOur board of directors has oversight of our strategic and business risk management and has delegated cybersecurity risk management oversight to the\naudit & risk oversight committee of our board of directors (Audit & Risk Oversight Committee). Our Audit & Risk Oversight Committee is responsible for\nensuring that management has processes in place designed to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks to which the company is exposed and to implement\nprocesses and programs to manage cybersecurity risks and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. The privacy committee of our board of directors (Privacy\nCommittee) oversees risks related to privacy and data use, including overseeing compliance with our comprehensive privacy program. Management is\nresponsible for identifying, assessing, and managing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to ensure that such potential\ncybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures, maintaining cybersecurity policies and procedures, and providing\nregular reports to our board of directors, including through the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and Privacy Committee.\nOur Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Guy Rosen leads our cybersecurity program and oversees teams across the company supporting our\nsecurity functions of identify, prevent, detect, respond, and recover. These teams are comprised of personnel with a broad range of experience across the private\nand public sectors, the technology industry, and different geographic regions. Mr. Rosen has two decades of experience in various cybersecurity, software\ndevelopment, product management, and other technology-related roles. Mr. Rosen has served in a number of significant leadership roles at our company since\n2013, including oversight of security, safety, and integrity initiatives, and was appointed as our CISO in 2022.\n51", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5497, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95e54aec-a36a-4a43-aadb-28905627ca5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "95e54aec-a36a-4a43-aadb-28905627ca5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ada02cd1-8d07-450c-a9a6-861263f2ec3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "df5984e6d07eba2433d9da63fbf280b84f5f89118383a139a7aff9c0c5943b86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1bcd912-60b3-4d8b-aaf3-9aa8e9cf8c59", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "cdf66bcb87ce7da50fc3c352390e45048314208276266d3c72c6ef9dc11e29e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "29e89978-0a56-413e-bb7e-71ec423c11ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b02aeb375c6cf0130b3a970c1fdb953748b2a349c58736690ba532910d797bac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nPrior to joining our company, Mr. Rosen served in senior leadership, engineering, and operational roles across technology organizations.\nOur cybersecurity teams monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through a variety of technical and\noperational measures, and regularly report to our CISO.

Any litigation to which we are a party may be resolved adversely or\nwe may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. We may also decide to settle litigation, disputes, or other legal\nproceedings in some instances on terms that are unfavorable to us. In addition, we may become subject to orders or consent decrees imposed by government or\nregulatory authorities. Any such developments could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our\npersonnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our\nbusiness (including changes to our products and services or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the\ntime and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business. We have\nexperienced such outcomes to varying degrees in the past, and we expect to continue to face a challenging litigation and regulatory environment, including in\nlight of complex and evolving laws and regulations, as well as the scale of our business and the size of our user and advertiser base.\nOver the last several years, the number and potential significance of the litigation and investigations involving the company have increased, and there\ncan be no assurance that this trend will not continue. For example, we are facing numerous cases in the United States in which plaintiffs are attempting to avoid\nor limit the application of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to their claims. Outside of the United States, we are subject to new regulatory\nregimes, including the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, and similar statutes in non-EU countries, and new fining guidelines under existing regulatory\nregimes like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We are also responding to litigation and government investigations related to our alleged role in\ncausing or contributing to various societal harms, including mental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users, child and adult\nsexual exploitation, illegal activity with respect to drugs, fraud, unlawful discrimination, and other harms potentially impacting large numbers of people.\n52", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5016, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29e89978-0a56-413e-bb7e-71ec423c11ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "29e89978-0a56-413e-bb7e-71ec423c11ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41e65898-f4ef-43d7-8ea2-4687f2e63bf1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "4285f64d3b03d0b16aa9f10882bdafe36c45934bf7654eb8bf1e3d1afc7abaa9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "95e54aec-a36a-4a43-aadb-28905627ca5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "df5984e6d07eba2433d9da63fbf280b84f5f89118383a139a7aff9c0c5943b86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "286bcb5e-b3f4-437b-b8f4-cad752cff917", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "43409438fe1f824701ee9a2da1cf4a6d34516441817e7021b0bff2c285f6ebbc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nThis is in addition to significant tax, antitrust, stockholder, and privacy litigation and investigations. Furthermore, as the number of our users and amount of our\nrevenue have grown, our potential exposure to substantial damages awards and fines has increased.\nIn some instances, particularly with novel legal and factual claims, new regulatory regimes or statutes that have not previously been enforced, or where\nthe nature or type of enforcement pursued against us is novel, it can be very difficult to assess the likelihood or extent of potential liabilities, including the\napplicability and amount of any fines or penalties.

With\nrespect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several\nof the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (In re\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the\nconsolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for\na payment of $725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. In addition,\nour platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement\nand modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly\nenhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other\njurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of\nChancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data\npractices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery\nCourt action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our\nhistorical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder\nderivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc.

Meta Platforms, Inc.). On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and\ndenied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action\nbrought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated complaint filed in the\nputative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. In December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we\ntie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules.\nOn February 6, 2019, the German Federal Cartel Office (FCO) issued an antitrust injunction order claiming that our terms and policies on data sharing\nacross our apps, and collection from third-party websites via our business tools, breached European data protection principles and German competition law. We\nbrought a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the order on February 11, 2019. On March 24, 2021, the Higher Regional Court, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany referred several\nquestions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) including certain questions regarding interpretation of the GDPR. On July 4, 2023, the CJEU\nissued a decision which in particular made it more difficult to rely on \"legitimate interests,\" and \"contractual necessity\" as opposed to user \"consent,\" as a legal\nbasis for data processing under the GDPR for ads and personalization purposes.\nThe result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our\nbusiness practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely\naffect our business.\nSecurities and Other Actions\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and\nelsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of\nour terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court\nin the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of California (In Re Facebook, Inc. Securities Litigation) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our\nplatform and user data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims. On January 17,\n2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued\nits decision affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case.\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices.

The first cash dividend will be paid on March 26, 2024 to all holders of record of common stock at the close\nof business on February 22, 2024.\nThe payment of future cash dividends is subject to future declaration by our board of directors, which will be based in part on continued capital\navailability, market conditions, applicable laws and agreements, and our board of directors continuing to determine that the declaration of dividends is in the\nbest interests of our stockholders.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nThe following table summarizes the share repurchase activity for the three months ended December 31, 2023:\nTotal Number of Shares\nPurchasedAverage Price Paid Per\nShare Total Number of Shares\nPurchased as Part of Publicly\nAnnounced Programs Approximate Dollar Value of\nShares that May Yet Be Purchased\nUnder the Plans or Programs \n(in thousands) (in thousands) (in millions)\nOctober 1 - 31, 2023 10,105 $ 294.59 10,105 $ 34,246 \nNovember 1 - 30, 2023 \u2014 $ \u2014 \u2014 $ 34,246 \nDecember 1 - 31, 2023 9,607 $ 345.27 9,607 $ 30,929 \nTotal 19,712 19,712 \n____________________________________\n(1) On November 18, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January\n2017 and does not have an expiration date.

In addition to our historical\nconsolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual\nresults could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those\ndiscussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the\nmeasurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant\ncurrency basis is presented in the section entitled \"\u2014Revenue\u2014Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we\ntranslated revenue for the full year 2023 using 2022 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full\ndescription of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the section entitled \"\u2014Liquidity and Capital Resources\u2014Free Cash Flow.\"\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and\npresented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non\u2011GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness\nfor comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors\nshould be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial\nresults between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics\nused by management in operating our business.\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2023 Results\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\nOur financial results and key community metrics for 2023 are set forth below. Our total revenue for 2023 was $134.90 billion, an increase of 16%\ncompared to 2022, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 15% compared to 2022. Ad\nimpressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased 28% year-over-year in 2023, partially offset by a 9% year-over-year decrease in the average price\nper ad.\nIncome from operations for 2023 was $46.75 billion, an increase of $17.81 billion, or 62%, compared to 2022, driven by an increase in advertising\nrevenue.\n59", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3511, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7491e0d-5710-423e-b63d-c72ce3f2504f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7491e0d-5710-423e-b63d-c72ce3f2504f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99cb46ba-fff6-43db-b2b1-87ceaffd649a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "79c13d17f4afcb7eea7532aa6082cb4ee98d8f03df89043bdea52dc780fc56e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1479c1cb-c524-4a58-93f8-974e8e3f82d0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "6786043ae9d6fe7715abb028881aac65243eb093839f7e5ecd4ed22c2a09c5d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5ea6bfa-f752-4928-9780-c6c6657f90f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ddf34c68bedb192c3e5054cf3e4602521c49b46ac3810bc041564cf542673dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nConsolidated and Segment Results\nWe report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).

Our\nadvertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targeting\nand measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.\nIn particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including its evolving interpretation through\ndecisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive, the European Digital Services Act, and U.S. state privacy laws including the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and we\nexpect these and other\n61", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3660, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1a13644-16a6-464b-9405-3eac5e7bbd3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1a13644-16a6-464b-9405-3eac5e7bbd3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aaf24148-a231-4e58-b7dc-4f5cdd8b6883", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "c685c92a688d3f8540b69058295cecad6dcd1816aef39e31af5ddb532ba86717", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5ea6bfa-f752-4928-9780-c6c6657f90f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "c57d85677e95be3d06b2f8777e384c870fa33019f079acb24e98ac475b541e2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "295ffd47-10e0-4732-a0e3-75f2ccc4e3b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b7b9f0af6ae716b32bf3bb32cca15dccb41a716e39c7c41e46f751785b24f0e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\ndevelopments such as the Digital Markets Act will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement,\nwhether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. For example,\nin response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in\nthe EU, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\"\nalternative. We are continuing to engage with regulators on our new consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple\nand Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use\nthese signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with\nchanges to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we\nexpect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.\nTo mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are\ndeveloping privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we\nprocess, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data\ninto our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools\nto help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad\nproducts. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery,\ntargeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new\nfeatures and scaling existing features.\nWe are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for\nadvertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers.\nHowever, we expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described above will\ncontinue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\nOther Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our\nuser growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as\ninflation, rising interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. While we saw improvement in business and\nmacroeconomic conditions in 2023, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which could impact our financial results in\nfuture periods. In addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services. We are investing in Reels\nand in AI initiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant content, which we have already seen results in\nimproved user engagement and monetization of our products. While Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our feed and Stories products\nand we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user\nbase in one or more regions from time to time. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia\nand the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which continued to adversely affect user growth and engagement in 2023. These trends\nadversely affected advertising revenue in 2023, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.\nAlthough we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have perfect visibility into the factors\ndriving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex judgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified\nadvertiser base across the globe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to identify with precision\nwhich advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to quantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising\nrevenue during the periods presented.\n62", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5453, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "295ffd47-10e0-4732-a0e3-75f2ccc4e3b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "295ffd47-10e0-4732-a0e3-75f2ccc4e3b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "547aa686-cfd7-4ab3-a4d6-8f0c3a6d0189", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "b2a7d1cb65331e089d1e309250d7981b44b89172e21b045d6738bc983fc68348", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1a13644-16a6-464b-9405-3eac5e7bbd3f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "c685c92a688d3f8540b69058295cecad6dcd1816aef39e31af5ddb532ba86717", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8cc0205e-5c94-4e18-8670-a3db6e441bd5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d625b0a7543c5bae109eda14504012df6ea165465d2cdd3ce87cc6213a919e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nInvestment Philosophy\nWe expect to continue to build on the discipline and habits that we developed in 2022 when we initiated several efforts to increase our operating\nefficiency, while still remaining focused on investing in significant opportunities. In 2023, 80% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and\n20% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to\ndevelop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI initiatives, including to recommend relevant content across\nour products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI.\nWe are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices, software for\nsocial platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies for the metaverse. Our RL investments include expenses relating to technology\ndevelopment across these efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products for the\nmetaverse that may only be fully realized in the next decade. In 2023, our RL segment reduced our overall operating profit by approximately $16.12 billion,\nand we expect our RL operating losses to increase meaningfully in 2024. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative, and our ability to\nsupport our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing\nbasis, we evaluate our accounting estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the\ncircumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and\njudgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial\nstatements. We believe that the estimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when applicable, have the\ngreatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For further information\non all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 \u2014 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.\nCertain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any\nfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we\nevaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the\namount can be reasonably estimated.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\nrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our\ndefenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is\nrequired to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and\nunasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated\ninformation available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations\nregarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted\nagainst us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the Irish Data\nProtection Commission, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of\nan inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be\nrevised in future quarters.\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonably\npossible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of\nmanagement's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome\nbecomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 12 \u2014 Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15 \u2014 Income Taxes of the\naccompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3,\n\"Legal Proceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for\nincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.

These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that\nhave been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and\ndevelopment tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits\nwill be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide\nno assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, as significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our\nprovision for income taxes. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances\nchange, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts\nrecorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on\nour financial condition and operating results.\nValuation of Assets\nThe valuation and impairment assessment of certain assets, including recoverability, requires significant judgment and assumptions such as estimation of\nfuture cash flows, discount rates, market data of comparable assets and companies, holding period and residual value of asset groups, among others.\nImpairment testing for long-lived-assets, including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, occurs whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable compared to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected\nto generate from the use and eventual disposition. The impairment test is performed at the asset group level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the test results indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the\ncarrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\nImpairment testing for non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative, is\nperformed at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. Such qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not\nlimited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment;\noperational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair\nvalue of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in our consolidated\nstatements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. In addition, for these non-marketable equity securities, determining whether a\nnon-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the non-marketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of\ndifferences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b)\nadjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most\nadvantageous markets. The identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies,\nwhich may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur\nin a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred.\n72", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4452, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ce6a12d-37bc-40d9-b8ee-57f8d79e3756": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ce6a12d-37bc-40d9-b8ee-57f8d79e3756", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e19bb213-3c45-4dc3-a9ef-2dc6aa007a7b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "2d3eb3d5e0b0cf24bede7c9b5be3823f6e13b6882f1605e12fa35e44b930753d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "73a15c0a-3e51-4aa9-9da4-ec4f83144469", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "3e7bcb24d59a53cd92e2ca4fed84d9e2542fef0dd901ab96ff965942f9f27a6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "62e42787-ba5c-47e9-bb2a-ea8a52b8aa48", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "02445de2fdc0f37e4cf3676b28b70a1fc80a205453cd4e2d26027a362619f1ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nFamily of Apps (FoA)\nAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook,\nInstagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising\nagencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are\nconsidered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the\naction the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the\nstructure of our ads products. In particular, the ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels products are not currently monetized at the\nsame rate as our feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or decrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and\nmonetization strategies. We calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average price\npaid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the\nprincipal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\nOther revenue. Other revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments\ninfrastructure and revenue from various other sources.\nReality Labs (RL)\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related software and content.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These mainly include expenses\nrelated to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well\nas payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of\nrevenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing\ncustomer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content\ncosts.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist mostly of payroll and related expenses which include share-based\ncompensation, RL technology development costs, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for\ndeveloping new products as well as improving existing products, and restructuring charges.\nMarketing and sales.

The increase was almost entirely driven by advertising revenue.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenue in 2023 increased $18.31 billion, or 16%, compared to 2022 due to an increase in the number of ads delivered, partially offset by a\ndecrease in the average price per ad. In 2023, the number of ads delivered increased by 28%, as compared with an 18% increase in 2022 as ads impressions\ngrew in all regions during 2023, especially in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The increase in the ads delivered during 2023 was driven by increases in the\nnumber and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users. In 2023, the average price per ad decreased by 9%, as compared with a\ndecrease of 16% in 2022. The decrease in average price per ad was driven by an increase in the number of ads delivered, especially in geographies and in\nproducts, such as Reels, that monetize at lower rates. While the average price per ad declined year-over-year, we believe the improvements to our ad targeting\nand measurement tools have had a favorable impact on our ad performance and advertising demand. Other factors are also discussed in the section entitled \"\u2014\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2023 Results.\" In addition, year-over-year advertising revenue growth for the full year 2023 was driven mainly by marketer\nspending in online commerce, which benefited from marketers based in China, consumer packaged goods, and entertainment and media. We anticipate that\nfuture advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered.\nOther revenue\nFoA other revenue in 2023 increased $250 million, or 31%, compared to 2022. The increase was mainly driven by WhatsApp Business Platform\nrevenue.\nReality Labs\nRL revenue in 2023 decreased $263 million, or 12%, compared to 2022. The decrease in RL revenue was mostly driven by a net decrease in the volume\nof Meta Quest sales.\nRevenue Seasonality\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality in\nboth advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third\nand fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 17%, 16%, and 16% between the\nthird and fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021 declined 11%, 17%, and 7%\ncompared to the fourth quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.\n75", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3157, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41309895-ce5d-4e15-8e86-957cce1d927d": {"__data__": {"id_": "41309895-ce5d-4e15-8e86-957cce1d927d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ff967efc-0e89-4b9d-8e7c-e472889db6e5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "1cc5a32019db94744857c4c56ed76b0fed3eefb36f9312ab638b5cb07c3343d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d091b838-3536-4681-8953-26d8850c91b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "c841beef188cfb98a9c62b6d92da7a262b09e05957e30ad611ca26c0da21ba42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c1de4df-4e04-4666-b6fb-5dd46d55a947", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "23adbef43cf1befb07b596b403f868229d4349b071a781889996d6c8db397568", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue\nChanges in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our total revenue in the full year 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.

This was partially offset by a\ndecrease in the proportion of U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income relative to income before provision for income taxes and additional\nclarification issued by the IRS in September 2023 regarding research and development expenses subject to mandatory capitalization and amortization.\nEffective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision\nfor income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects from\ncapital losses not expected to be utilized, restructurings, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes\nin tax law.\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based\ncompensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price\nremains constant to the January 26, 2024 price, and absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2024 to be in the mid-\nteens. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses incurred in 2023, as required by the\n2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our 2023 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreased our\neffective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is deferred, our effective tax rate in 2024\ncould be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be lower.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2023, we had net uncertain tax positions of $6.95 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. These\nunrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of\nintellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties regarding the utilization of our research tax credits. The ultimate\nsettlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based\nupon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts\nwithin the next 12 months.\nSee Note 15 \u2014 Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income tax contingencies.\n78", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3607, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db26ad0f-ec1c-459a-85b3-692d00971446": {"__data__": {"id_": "db26ad0f-ec1c-459a-85b3-692d00971446", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "65acbb2c-3e77-4f03-ad5c-47b53bb5f965", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "dc6baed6bc30a4d5005281540a0693ab932e2002224c7926a52b96b4e49f7090", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4fd9dfc-7077-4118-b3ad-d35e64438124", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "713228cb214d0b4eb1050e5cc8e17de43d92cbc09ad66cd3226c9baf26360e65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f2fe77a-83ac-4c8c-8229-3dc098622182", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d63b683990af9b9da2c387ee49f8000bd2dd908a1be50c11c77287e39219db0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations.

These increases were partially offset by $28.10 billion for capital expenditures,\nincluding principal payments on finance leases, $19.77 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, and $7.01 billion of taxes paid related to net share\nsettlement of employee restricted stock unit (RSU) awards.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 71,113 $ 50,475 $ 57,683 \nNet cash used in investing activities $ (24,495)$ (28,970)$ (7,570)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (19,500)$ (22,136)$ (50,728)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during 2023 mostly consisted of $39.10 billion net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as\n$14.03 billion of share-based compensation expense and $11.18 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, as well as $3.29 billion of favorable changes\nin working capital. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during 2023 compared to 2022 was mostly due to an increase in cash collection from\nour customers driven by the increase in revenue, and a decrease in payments to our vendors.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2023 mostly consisted of $27.05 billion of net purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in\ndata centers, servers, and network infrastructure, partially offset by $3.20 billion net proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable debt securities. The\ndecrease in cash used in investing activities during 2023 compared to 2022 was mostly due to a decrease in purchases of property and equipment.\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $30 billion to $37 billion in 2024.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during 2023 mostly consisted of $19.77 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $7.01 billion of taxes\npaid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by $8.46 billion proceeds from the issuance of the Notes in May 2023.

See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\u2014 Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring\nmonetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this\ntime, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency\nexchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency exchange net losses of\n$366 million, $81 million, and $140 million were recognized in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and\nthe fair value of our long-term debt.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S.\ngovernment agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and\nsupporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the\nmarket value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $355 million and\n$558 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Any realized\ngains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized gains or losses would only occur if we sold the investments prior to\nmaturity.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we also had aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate senior notes (the Notes) outstanding of $18.50 billion and\n$10.00 billion, respectively. Since our Notes bear interest at fixed rates and are carried at amortized cost, fluctuations in interest rates do not have any impact\non our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing in periods of\ndeclining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.\n82", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3270, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f055e921-0f79-459d-b3ec-74832a360aa5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f055e921-0f79-459d-b3ec-74832a360aa5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd1d8a60-cba0-499d-bdc9-91b009be1f39", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "f1df8c5604310bec540dde2652486150febeddc96917728dfee6ac87f001c8fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd27add5-28f1-43ba-8f8b-68fa3b378cf0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "2917b026c8d1a0e9a8763ff2d710edc66dcb13038fecd9044678ff8fa50cea2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce1f26b9-2ed8-4751-9966-700282bbf26a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "aafe25849a50191f8df910b4082d05db6a9cd6414cc7ef87036902de491f4a36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nEquity Price Risk\nOur equity investments are in non-marketable equity securities and are subject to equity price risks that could have a material impact on the carrying\nvalue of our holdings.\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values. We elected to account for\nsubstantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair\nvalue resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date\nto determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial\ncondition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the\ninvestee. Valuations of our non-marketable equity securities are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions.\nUncertainties in the global economic climate and financial markets could adversely impact the valuation of these companies we invest in and, therefore, result\nin a material impairment or downward adjustment in our investments.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

In our\nopinion, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023,\nbased on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated\nbalance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity\nand cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 1, 2024 expressed an\nunqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is\nto express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Mateo, California\nFebruary 1, 2024\n88", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4149, "text_template":

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Description of Business\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. All of\nour products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.\nWe report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The segment information aligns with\nhow the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our chief executive officer (CEO), reviews and manages the business. We generate substantially all of\nour revenue from advertising.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The consolidated financial\nstatements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where we have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for\nwhich we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts\nin the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets\nand liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not\nlimited to, those related to loss contingencies, income taxes, valuation of long-lived assets and their associated estimated useful lives, valuation of non-\nmarketable equity securities, revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and accounts receivable, and\nfair value of financial instruments and leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events, interpretation of regulations, and\nexpectations about actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue From Contracts With Customers. Revenue is recognized when\ncontrol of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for\nthose goods or services.\nSales commissions we pay in connection with contracts are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are\nrecorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for\ncontracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\nRevenue includes sales and usage\u2011based taxes, except for cases where we are acting as a pass\u2011through agent.\nAdvertising Revenue\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for\nad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of\nactions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered.

Revenue is\nrecognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration\nRL expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and\nrevenue from various other sources.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These mainly include expenses related to the\noperation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll\nand related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also\nincludes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer\ntransactions; RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content costs.\nContent Costs\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform.\nWe pay fees to these content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee, or both. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is\naccepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to\ndate.\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax\nrates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the\ndeferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.

For additional information, see Note 6 \u2014 Non-marketable Equity Securities.\nIn addition, we also held other non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value\nin the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are\nrequired to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk\nmeasurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels\nand bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2- Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\nliabilities.\nLevel 3- Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing\nthe asset or liability.\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because their fair value is derived\nfrom quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. Certain other assets are classified within Level 3\nbecause factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity.\nOur non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. When\nindicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and\nother unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts.

Depreciation is computed using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use (ROU) assets are described below:\nProperty and Equipment Useful Life/ Amortization period\nServers and network assets Four to Five years\nBuildings 25 to 30 years\nEquipment and other One to 25 years\nFinance lease right-of-use assets Three to 20 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable,\nand the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized.

For additional\ninformation regarding our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 \u2014 Restructuring.\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for\nthe remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful lives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and\ncircumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological\nadvancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively\nand depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nServers and network assets include property and equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support production traffic. Land and assets held\nwithin CIP are not depreciated. CIP is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their\nintended use. We capitalize interest on our debt related to certain eligible CIP assets and depreciate over the useful life of the related assets.\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated\ndepreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\nLease Obligations\nOur operating leases mostly comprise of certain offices, data centers, and colocations. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We\ndetermine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments\nfor maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a single lease\ncomponent.

For certain colocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively\naccount for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at the\ncommencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time\nof commencement.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining\nthe probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors. We do not assume renewals in our\ndetermination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual\nvalue guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement\ndate in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a\nsimilar economic environment.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on\nour consolidated balance sheets.\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the\nshorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net impairment losses of $2.43 billion and $2.22 billion in aggregate for operating\nlease ROU assets and leasehold improvements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts. The fair values of the\nimpaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The\nassumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the\nremaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows. For additional information regarding our\nrestructuring efforts, see Note 3 \u2014 Restructuring.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.\nCertain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any\nfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we\nevaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the\namount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably\nestimated, we record such losses as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income and disclose the possible loss in the\naccompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their\nestimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and\nliabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration to\nidentifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any\nindefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition\ndate, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement\nperiod, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are\nexpensed as incurred.\n100", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5293, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69e6c4ea-f924-4c95-b572-b2ef60d40359": {"__data__": {"id_": "69e6c4ea-f924-4c95-b572-b2ef60d40359", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ebdef0aa-4c74-421b-96e4-32050c999859", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "debc181e4dfea63096e998c54cb7db56dc86938e4bb7b0cce8560d014f4f10ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "02b2e7e0-5cdd-4a55-9db1-69fad293b984", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "b9ac122e7cc22b58ecad2370ada3c532bf9784460422895e5d29c21fe12b5ef3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1140b310-4737-431f-910f-82747f1de4ca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6bb4ef3f1df538e65bbb81ffa737eb03d96ba70db7a4a45e97e2aebbce965a20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our reporting units annually, as well as\nwhen changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is\ntested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2023, no\nimpairment of goodwill has been identified.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these intangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are\nlargely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the\nfuture undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of\nfinite-lived intangible assets is not recoverable, and the assets fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We have not\nrecorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are\nnot amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and\naccounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives\nof finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the\nrevised estimated useful life.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to\nU.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and\nlosses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had\ncumulative translation losses, net of tax of $1.24 billion and $1.86 billion, respectively.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved\nare recorded within interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions\nwere $366 million, $81 million, and $140 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nCredit Risk and Concentration\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash,\nmarketable securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consists mostly of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency\nsecurities. Marketable securities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt\nsecurities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions and our marketable securities are held in\ndiversified highly rated securities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers. The amount\nof credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023 was not material.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries. We generated\n37%, 40%, and 41% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United\nStates, with a majority of the revenue outside of the United States in 2023 coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Brazil, Australia, Canada\nand Japan.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral.

Earnings per Share\nWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. As the liquidation and dividend rights for both\nClass A and Class B common stock are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis to the weighted-average number of common\nshares outstanding for the period.\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. For\nthe calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including restricted stock units (RSUs) awards under our\nEquity Incentive Plan.\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A common\nstock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed by\ndividing the resulting net income by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 16 million and 95 million shares of Class A common stock equivalents of RSUs were\nexcluded from the diluted EPS calculation, respectively, as including them would have an anti-dilutive effect. RSUs with anti-dilutive effect were not material\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021.\nBasic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.\nThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as follows (in millions, except per\nshare amounts):\n Year Ended December 31,\n 2023 2022 2021\n Class\nAClass\nBClass\nAClass\nBClass\nAClass\nB \nBasic EPS:       \nNumerator       \nNet income $33,722 $ 5,376 $19,729 $ 3,471 $33,328 $ 6,042 \nDenominator       \nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share 2,220 354 2,285 402 2,383 432 \nBasic EPS $ 15.19 $ 15.19 $ 8.63 $ 8.63 $ 13.99 $ 13.99 \nDiluted EPS:     \nNumerator       \nNet income $33,722 $ 5,376 $19,729 $ 3,471 $33,328 $ 6,042 \nReallocation of net income as a result of conversion of Class B to\nClass A common stock 5,376 \u2014 3,471 \u2014 6,042 \u2014 \nReallocation of net income to Class B common stock \u2014 (112) \u2014 (19) \u2014 (93)\nNet income for diluted EPS $39,098 $ 5,264 $23,200 $ 3,452 $39,370 $ 5,949 \nDenominator       \nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share 2,220 354 2,285 402 2,383 432 \nConversion of Class B to Class A common stock 354 \u2014 402 \u2014 432 \u2014 \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive RSUs 55 \u2014 15 \u2014 44 \u2014 \nShares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 2,629 354 2,702 402 2,859 432 \nDiluted EPS $ 14.87 $ 14.87 $ 8.59 $ 8.59 $ 13.77 $ 13.77 \n106", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2833, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9925fac-24e4-447e-969b-1accf26f3c52": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9925fac-24e4-447e-969b-1accf26f3c52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3987365-9d21-4e23-938b-fe88dacf4d7d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "bd0155a964dba5a0e7d40effe6ad72e479d373cbb572dd332e2cb26837c12c5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "90fcd954-8db9-49a7-8a58-3e6d8a9a5170", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "f03316415b4064f98f9b1369685566bf4fdf5d06c8af364a5b8f982e34588d17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1023aff1-9e4c-4580-9cd1-66dc14110e75", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3851ec252e567552eaa68a0bcd6a8182cce28b420cb538c49d55272ee25ae61a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nNote 5.

We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either\nindividually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or\nprobable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved\nagainst us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period\nin which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 15 \u2014 Income Taxes.\nPrivacy and Related Matters\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and\ncertain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain\ndata by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. With\nrespect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several\nof the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (In re\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the\nconsolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for\na payment of $725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. In addition,\nour platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement\nand modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a\npenalty of $5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain\ngovernment inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing.

The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a\nproposed order and include, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of\ndirectors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for\nthe District of Columbia (USA v. Facebook, Inc.) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On\nNovember 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (U.S. v.\nFacebook, Inc.) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. On January 12, 2024, the district court denied our motion for a stay\npending appeal and, on January 25, 2024, we filed a motion for a stay pending appeal before the Court of Appeals. On November 29, 2023, we separately filed\na complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC), asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the\nFTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our\nmotion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. Oral argument on our motion to enjoin and the FTC\u2019s motion to dismiss is scheduled\nfor March 1, 2024. If the FTC proceeding is not enjoined or stayed, our response in the proceeding will be due on March 15, 2024, after which time the FTC\ncould amend the order to impose these additional requirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision\nmodifying the order and could request the appellate court to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is unclear\nwhether the appeal or the request for a stay would be successful.\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators\nregarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms\nIreland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance\nwith the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR \u20ac1.2 billion as well as corrective orders, which is described further in \"Legal Proceedings\"\ncontained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the Court of\nJustice of the European Union, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the\nGDPR's cooperation and consistency mechanisms, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the\ninterpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty.\nAlthough we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related to these inquiries and\ninvestigations in Europe, and we believe there is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be material\nindividually or in the aggregate.\nOn February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court (Texas v.

On October 13, 2023, in In re Social Media Cases, the Los Angeles County Superior Court presiding\nover the California state court proceedings sustained in part and overruled in part our demurrer as to the plaintiff's claims. Beginning in October 2023,\nadditional U.S. states have filed lawsuits on these topics in various federal and state courts. These additional lawsuits include allegations regarding violations of\nthe Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) as well as violations of state laws concerning consumer protection, unfair business practices, and\nproducts liability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices and harms to users under 18 years old. These lawsuits seek damages and\ninjunctive relief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction Product Liability Personal Injury\nLitigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as well as various state courts around the country. We are also subject to government\ninvestigations and requests from multiple regulators concerning the use of our products, and the alleged mental and physical health and safety impacts on users,\nparticularly younger users.\nOther Actions\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size\nfor advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\nof California (DZ Reserve v. Facebook, Inc.) and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court\ndismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the\nplaintiffs' motion for class certification. On June 21, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the\ndistrict court's class certification order, and the court heard argument on September 12, 2023. The case is stayed in the district court pending appeal.\nBeginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Kadrey,\net al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. and Chabon, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.) and U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Huckabee, et al. v. Meta\nPlatforms, Inc. et al.), which was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California) alleging that we used various\ncopyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief.\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil,\nRussia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including\nour obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties\nagainst us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously\ndefend such fines and penalties.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain\nmatters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property\ninfringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of\nthe claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation\nand bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification\nclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2023, there was not a reasonable possibility we had incurred a\nmaterial loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability for costs related to indemnification through December 31,\n2023.\n119", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4867, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "514b5840-92a6-4128-9667-01ba4a21f1bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "514b5840-92a6-4128-9667-01ba4a21f1bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "08c9e5e7-9c64-454e-a998-a2a58e0a0af4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "491ceec3ee41d76e12083bbf49d4e78297d8c0df6ea134d5f09b200c0f0e4b15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d242e43-3202-44ad-aff1-5da0d06f2b59", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "1f59de93d9fd2e72fa2ab8e69a3d6a605bc60bf3a2a42ce6c8ffe747304103f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fbcbd4e4-2ed7-4138-ac31-a95da4ccd6ca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "868181441d882355d54a8afd15b5acbad653df62ffd648f1540c2443e4e281ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nNote 13.

During all years\npresented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of\nincome. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $1.48 billion, $1.07 billion, and $960 million\nrespectively.\nIf our gross unrecognized tax benefits of $11.67 billion as of December 31, 2023 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefit of\n$7.33 billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to\npotential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2017 through 2019 tax\nyears. Our 2014 through 2016 tax years are with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals for certain unresolved issues. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years\nremain open to examination by the IRS and the Irish Revenue Commissioners.\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\nwith the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years\nsubsequent to 2010 and has done so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a\npetition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an\nadjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was\ncompleted in August 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2024. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its\nupdated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the\namounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its\nposition from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and\ncertain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to\napproximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the\npositions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), that is lower than\nthe potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails\nin its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax\nthat we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2023, we have not\nresolved these matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax\nitems that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is\nreasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months.

Our\noperating segments are the same as our reportable segments.\nOur chief executive officer is our chief operating decision maker (CODM), who allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating\nsegment using information about the operating segment's revenue and income (loss) from operations. Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments using\nasset or liability information.\nRevenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include certain product development related\noperating expenses, costs associated with partnership arrangements, consumer hardware product costs, content costs, legal-related costs, and severance costs.\nIndirect costs are allocated to segments based on a reasonable allocation methodology, when such costs are significant to the performance measures of the\noperating segments. Indirect cost of revenue is allocated to our segments based on usage, such as costs related to the operation of our data centers and technical\ninfrastructure. Indirect operating expenses, such as facilities, information technology, certain shared research and development activities, recruiting, physical\nsecurity expenses, and certain restructuring costs, are mostly allocated based on headcount.\nThe following table sets forth our segment information of revenue and income (loss) from operations (in millions):\n Year Ended December 31, \n 2023 2022 2021\nRevenue:\nFamily of Apps $ 133,006 $ 114,450 $ 115,655 \nReality Labs 1,896 2,159 2,274 \nTotal revenue $ 134,902 $ 116,609 $ 117,929 \nIncome (loss) from operations:\nFamily of Apps $ 62,871 $ 42,661 $ 56,946 \nReality Labs (16,120) (13,717) (10,193)\nTotal income from operations $ 46,751 $ 28,944 $ 46,753 \nFor information regarding revenue disaggregated by geography, see Note 2 \u2014 Revenue.\nThe following table sets forth our long-lived assets by geographic area, which consist of property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use\nassets (in millions):\n December 31,\n 2023 2022\nUnited States $ 91,940 $ 76,334 \nRest of the world 17,941 15,857 \nTotal long-lived assets $ 109,881 $ 92,191 \n_________________________\n(1) No individual country , other than disclosed above, exceeded 10% of our total long-lived assets for any period presented.(1)\n125", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2637, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cdc54e5-b9a8-40ba-85bd-c532dc49356c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cdc54e5-b9a8-40ba-85bd-c532dc49356c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3930fb1e-e172-43b7-bd7a-d246ca3a34c9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "c1c1a5be6b2b7ba09180fb554de4ec547ad39b4ec4899c92b513e72a1ae31e7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e44113d8-5e98-42a2-a657-bdd4c391b287", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "570e224a4bb02964ce2082ee4636e07819a6daf960f70e4d1047bec429c42f6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1d8329c7-d91c-4ac4-a952-dd8294807b57", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a09c47acf8e530d4c2d3d79c282ece04579d1de40eae4aaf9458a71c42c8c838", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table of Contents\nItem 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A.Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)), as\nof the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31,\n2023, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we\nare required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under\nthe Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the\nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public\naccounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of\nthe Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In\naddition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints\nand that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nItem 9B.Other Information\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nOn November 30, 2023, Jennifer Newstead, our Chief Legal Officer, entered into a trading plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of\nRule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The trading plan provides for the sale of an aggregate of 10,968 shares of our Class A\ncommon stock and all shares received during the duration of the plan pursuant to Ms. Newstead's outstanding equity awards and any future equity award\ngrants, excluding any shares withheld by the company to satisfy its income tax withholding and remittance obligations in connection with the net settlement of\nthe equity awards.

Delaware law could\nrequire either holders of our Class A common stock or our Class B common stock to vote separately as a single class in the following circumstances:\n\u2022if we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of a class of stock, or to\nincrease or decrease the par value of a class of stock, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment; and\n\u2022if we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in a manner that alters or changes the powers, preferences or special\nrights of a class of stock in a manner that affected its holders adversely, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed\namendment.\nStockholders do not have the ability to cumulate votes for the election of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and\nrestated bylaws provide for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size, each serving staggered three-year terms,\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock. Our directors will be\nassigned by the then-current board of directors to a class when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the\ncombined voting power of common stock.\nNo Preemptive or Similar Rights\nOur common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions.\n1", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3164, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0193ce5-ddd6-4c86-be7a-4be53409ee47": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0193ce5-ddd6-4c86-be7a-4be53409ee47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8bbe7af2-145a-480f-a62d-38a42a6009f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "b9c6f08cfb0184256788a1c6cf469450ab430bc5d449ae8cb42d90f0a8e1bb36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7a2cdea4-dc6a-4474-8a33-f7d612a6788c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "Meta10K.pdf", "file_path": "/home/prasanna2001/AIE2/AI-Engineering-Cohort-2/MidTerm/DataRepository/Meta10K.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2481466, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "77e5c1046a7c5bb32ef0e623a62250e4e24981705c0ad446a7e26d2d5ad421ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf8b348a-5fff-4ce6-8488-29da9a3f012b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ab641dbe6b18469feb13a77bc9d6c81c41b2dd9c82c29a5d25fa886c67aa5e9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions\nUpon our dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders\nof our common stock, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights and payment of liquidation preferences, if\nany, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock.\nConversion\nThe outstanding shares of Class B common stock are convertible at any time as follows: (1) at the option of the holder, a share of Class B common stock\nmay be converted at any time into one share of Class A common stock or (2) upon the election of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of\nClass B common stock, all outstanding shares of Class B common stock may be converted into shares of Class A common stock.

Our board of directors also can increase or decrease the number of shares of any series, but not below the number of\nshares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred\nstock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of\npreferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nSo long as the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, Mark Zuckerberg\nwill effectively control all matters submitted to our stockholders for a vote, as well as the overall management and direction of our company, which will have\nthe effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another person from acquiring control of our company.\nAfter such time as the shares of our Class B common stock no longer represent a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, the\nprovisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying,\ndeferring or discouraging another person from acquiring control of our company.\nDelaware Law\nA Delaware corporation may \u201copt out\u201d of these provisions with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or an express provision in its\ncertificate of incorporation or bylaws resulting from a stockholders\u2019 amendment approved by at least a majority of the outstanding voting shares.

Any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a\nmajority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class until such time as shares of our Class B common stock represent less than\nthirty-five percent (35%) of the combined voting power of our common stock. This provision could delay or prevent the approval of a change in control\nthat might otherwise be approved by a majority of outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock voting together on a combined basis.\n\u2022Dual Class Stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mark\nZuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant\ncorporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets.\n\u2022Supermajority Approvals. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws do not provide that certain\namendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws by stockholders will require the approval of two-\nthirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock. However, when the outstanding shares of our Class B\ncommon stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate\nof incorporation or amended and restated bylaws by stockholders will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding\nshares of Class A and Class B common stock. This will have the effect of making it more difficult to amend our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation or amended and restated bylaws to remove or modify certain provisions.\n\u2022Board of Directors Vacancies. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that stockholders may\nfill vacant directorships. When the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of\ncommon stock, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws authorize only our board of directors to fill vacant\ndirectorships. In addition, the number of directors constituting our board of directors is set only by resolution adopted by a majority vote of our entire\nboard of directors. These provisions restricting the filling of vacancies will prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of our board of directors and\ngaining control of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees.\n\u2022Classified Board. Our board of directors is not classified. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws\nprovide that when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, our\nboard of directors will be classified into three classes of directors each of which will hold office for a three-year term. In addition, thereafter, directors may\nonly be removed from the board of directors for cause. The existence of a classified board could delay a successful tender offeror from obtaining majority\ncontrol of our board of directors, and the prospect of that delay might deter a potential offeror.\n\u2022Stockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders will be able to\ntake action by written consent. When the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of\ncommon stock, our stockholders will no longer be able to take action by written consent, and will only be able to take action at annual or special meetings\nof our stockholders. Stockholders will not be permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors.

Our amended and restated bylaws provide advance notice\nprocedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at any\nmeeting of stockholders. Our amended and restated bylaws also specify certain requirements regarding the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice.\nThese provisions may preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for\ndirectors at our meetings of stockholders.\n\u2022Issuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock. Our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to\n100,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the board of\ndirectors.
