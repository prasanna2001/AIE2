        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

Fine tuning is the process of tailoring a machine learning model to a specific application, which can be vital in achieving consistent and high quality performance. Let's jump on LoRA. Low-Rank Adaptation of LLMs (LoRA) So, in usual fine-tuning, we. Take a pretrained model. Do Transfer Learning over new training data to slightly adjust these pre-trained weights And that is the aim of LoRA — to take the change-in-weight matrix and approximate it with the product of two lower-rank matrices. ... Machine Learning. Lora----1. Follow. Written by AR. 29 ... Feb 18, 2024. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a machine learning technique that modifies a pretrained model (for example, an LLM or vision transformer) to better suit a specific, often smaller, dataset by adjusting only a small, low-rank subset of the model's parameters. This approach is important because it allows for efficient finetuning of ...

            "Tool Response: The attention mechanism is a technique used in machine learning and natural language processing to increase model accuracy by focusing on relevant data. It enables the model to focus on certain areas of the input data, giving more weight to crucial features and disregarding unimportant ones. 1. Introduction. Self-attention, also known as scaled dot-product attention, is a fundamental concept in the field of NLP and deep learning. It plays a pivotal role in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. The concept of \"attention\" in deep learning has its roots in the effort to improve Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for handling longer sequences or sentences. For instance, consider translating a sentence from one language to another. Translating a sentence word-by-word is usually not an option because it ignores the complex grammatical ...
